                    <p>This publication is intended to guide the planning, teaching and assessment
                        of global politics in schools. Global politics teachers are the primary
                        audience, although it is expected that teachers will use the guide to inform
                        students and parents about the course. </p>
                    <p>This guide can be found on the global politics page of the online curriculum
                        centre (OCC) at <a href="http://occ.ibo.org">occ.ibo.org</a>, a

                    <h2>The Diploma Programme</h2>
                    <p>The Diploma Programme is a rigorous pre-university course of study designed
                        for students in the 16&#160;to&#160;19 age range. It is a broad-based
                        two-year course that aims to encourage students to be knowledgeable and
                        inquiring, but also caring and compassionate. There is a strong emphasis on
                        encouraging students to develop intercultural understanding,
                        open-mindedness, and the attitudes necessary for them to respect and
                        evaluate a range of points of view. </p>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>The Diploma Programme model</h3>
                        <p>The course is presented as six academic areas enclosing a central core
                            (see figure 1). It encourages the concurrent study of a broad range of
                            academic areas. Students study: two modern languages (or a modern
                            language and a classical language); a humanities or social science
                            subject; an experimental science; mathematics; one of the creative arts.
                            It is this comprehensive range of subjects that makes the Diploma
                            Programme a demanding course of study designed to prepare students
                            effectively for university entrance. In each of the academic areas
                            students have flexibility in making their choices, which means they can
                            choose subjects that particularly interest them and that they may wish
                            to study further at university. </p>

                        <h3>Choosing the right combination</h3>
                        <p>Students are required to choose one subject from each of the six academic
                            areas, although they can, instead of an arts subject, choose two
                            subjects from another area. Normally, three subjects (and not more than
                            four) are taken at higher level (HL), and the others are taken at
                            standard level (SL). The IB recommends 240 teaching hours for HL
                            subjects and 150 hours for SL. Subjects at HL are studied in greater
                            depth and breadth than at SL. </p>
                        <p>At both levels, many skills are developed, especially those of critical
                            thinking and analysis. At the end of the course, students’ abilities are
                            measured by means of external assessment. Many subjects contain some
                            element of coursework assessed by teachers. </p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>The core of the Diploma Programme model</h3>
                        <p>All Diploma Programme students participate in the three elements that
                            make up the core of the model. </p>
                        <p>Theory of knowledge (TOK) is a course that is fundamentally about
                            critical thinking and inquiry into the process of knowing rather than
                            about learning a specific body of knowledge. The TOK course examines the
                            nature of knowledge and how we know what we claim to know. It does this
                            by encouraging students to analyse knowledge claims and explore
                            questions about the construction of knowledge. The task of TOK is to
                            emphasize connections between areas of shared knowledge and link them to
                            personal knowledge in such a way that an individual becomes more aware
                            of his or her own perspectives and how they might differ from others. </p>
                        <p>Creativity, activity, service (CAS) is at the heart of the Diploma
                            Programme. CAS enables students to live out the IB learner profile in
                            real and practical ways, to grow as unique individuals and to recognise
                            their role in relation to others. Students develop skills, attitudes and
                            dispositions through a variety of individual and group experiences that
                            provides students opportunities to explore their interests and express
                            their passions, personalities and perspectives. CAS complements a
                            challenging academic programme in a holistic way, providing
                            opportunities for self-determination, collaboration, accomplishment and
                            enjoyment. </p>
                        <p>The three strands of CAS are: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Creativity—exploring and extending ideas leading to an original or
                                interpretive product or performance </li>
                            <li>Activity—physical exertion contributing to a healthy lifestyle </li>
                            <li>Service—collaborative and reciprocal engagement with the community
                                in response to an authentic need </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The extended essay, including the world studies extended essay, offers
                            the opportunity for IB students to investigate a topic of special
                            interest, in the form of a 4,000-word piece of independent research. The
                            area of research undertaken is chosen from one of the students’ six
                            Diploma Programme subjects, or in the case of the inter-disciplinary
                            world studies essay, two subjects, and acquaints them with the
                            independent research and writing skills expected at university. This
                            leads to a major piece of formally presented, structured writing, in
                            which ideas and findings are communicated in a reasoned and coherent
                            manner, appropriate to the subject or subjects chosen. It is intended to
                            promote high-level research and writing skills, intellectual discovery
                            and creativity. An authentic learning experience, it provides students
                            with an opportunity to engage in personal research on a topic of choice,
                            under the guidance of a supervisor. </p>

                        <p>Approaches to teaching and learning across the Diploma Programme refers
                            to deliberate strategies, skills and attitudes which permeate the
                            teaching and learning environment. These approaches and tools,
                            intrinsically linked with the learner profile attributes, enhance
                            student learning and assist student preparation for the Diploma

                        <h3>Academic honesty</h3>
                        <p>Academic honesty in the Diploma Programme is a set of values and
                            behaviours informed by the attributes of the learner profile. In
                            teaching, learning and assessment, academic honesty serves to promote
                            personal integrity, engender respect for the integrity of others and
                            their work, and ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to
                            demonstrate the knowledge and skills they acquire during their studies. </p>
                        <p>All coursework—including work submitted for assessment—is to be
                            authentic, based on the student’s individual and original ideas with the
                            ideas and work of others fully acknowledged. Assessment tasks that
                            require teachers to provide guidance to students or that require
                            students to work collaboratively must be completed in full compliance
                            with the detailed guidelines provided by the IB for the relevant
                            subjects. </p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>Global politics</h3>
                        <p>The 21st century is characterized by rapid change and increasing
                            interconnectedness, impacting individuals and societies in unprecedented
                            ways and creating complex global political challenges. Global politics
                            is an exciting, dynamic subject that draws on a variety of disciplines
                            in the social sciences and humanities, reflecting the complex nature of
                            many contemporary political issues. The study of global politics enables
                            students to critically engage with different and new perspectives and
                            approaches to politics in order to comprehend the challenges of the
                            changing world and become aware of their role in it as active global
                            citizens. </p>
                        <p>The Diploma Programme global politics course explores fundamental
                            political concepts such as power, equality, sustainability and peace in
                            a range of contexts. It allows students to develop an understanding of
                            the local, national, international and global dimensions of political
                            activity and processes, as well as to explore political issues affecting
                            their own lives. The course helps students to understand abstract
                            political concepts by grounding them in real-world examples and case
                            studies. It also invites comparison between such examples and case
                            studies to ensure a wider and transnational perspective. </p>
                        <p>The core units of the course together make up a central unifying theme of
                            “people, power and politics”. The emphasis on “people” reflects the fact
                            that the course explores politics not only at a state level but also
                            explores the function and impact of non-state actors, communities,
                            groups and individuals. The concept of “power” is also emphasised as
                            being particularly crucial to understanding the dynamics, tensions and
                            outcomes of global politics. Throughout the course, issues such as
                            conflict, migration or climate change are explored through an explicitly
                            political lens: “politics” provide a uniquely rich context in which to
                            explore the relationship between people and power. </p>

                        <h3>Distinction between SL and HL</h3>
                        <p>Students of global politics at SL and HL are presented with a syllabus
                            that has a common core. This common core consists of four compulsory
                            units under the central unifying theme of “people, power and politics”.
                            All SL and HL students are also required to undertake an engagement
                            activity. In addition, HL students are also required, through a case
                            studies approach, to explore two HL extension topics (global political
                            challenges). </p>
                        <p>In summary:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>SL and HL students study the four core units and undertake an
                                engagement activity</li>
                            <li>through a case studies approach, HL students also examine and
                                evaluate two global political challenges, which by their nature are
                                complex, contestable and interlinked; this provides further depth at
                                HL. </li>

                        <h3>Global politics and the core</h3>
                        <p>As with all Diploma Programme courses, global politics should both
                            support, and be supported by, the three elements of the Diploma
                            Programme core. </p>
                        <h4>Global politics and theory of knowledge</h4>
                        <p>As with other areas of knowledge, there are a variety of ways of gaining
                            knowledge in the social sciences. For example, experimentation and
                            observation, inductive and deductive reasoning, data and evidence
                            collection, and discussion can all be used to help to understand and
                            explain patterns of human behaviour. Students in individuals and
                            societies subjects are required to evaluate the resulting knowledge
                            claims by exploring questions about their validity, reliability,
                            credibility and certainty, as well as individual and cultural
                            perspectives on them. Having followed a course of study in an
                            individuals and societies subject, students should be able to reflect
                            critically on the various ways of knowing and on the methods used in the
                            social sciences, and in so doing become inquiring, knowledgeable and
                            caring young people, as set forth in the IB learner profile. </p>
                        <p>The study of global politics makes use of the social scientific methods
                            of gaining knowledge described above. Political issues emerge and unfold
                            in a variety of ways and contexts and tend to concern matters about
                            which people may care deeply. Consequently, a critical study of such
                            issues requires students to examine and reason about the observable, but
                            also to investigate what lies behind political deliberations and
                            decisions. What are the motivations of the various actors? On which
                            assumptions do these actors base their beliefs, policies and behaviours?
                            How do the power dynamics of a situation influence motivations,
                            assumptions and outcomes? </p>
                        <p>Diverse ways of knowing come into play when actors in global politics
                            take positions and aim to affect change: solid reasoning and skillful
                            use of language matter, of course, but many messages are sent and
                            received through non-verbal communication, and emotions are heavily
                            involved in political debates. </p>
                        <p>Studying political issues in this analytical, in-depth and engaged way,
                            students also come to consider the role, nature and origin of their own
                            political beliefs and positions, and of knowledge claims about politics
                            in their own cultures, in the cultures of others and around the world.
                            This way, students are encouraged to become more aware of themselves as
                            thinkers, to appreciate the complexity of knowledge in the human sphere,
                            and to recognize the need to act responsibly in an increasingly
                            interconnected but unpredictable world. </p>
                        <p>Examples of questions related to theory of knowledge that global politics
                            students might consider include the following. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How does knowledge in the social sciences differ from knowledge in
                                other areas?</li>
                            <li>How does knowledge in global politics differ from knowledge in some
                                other social science disciplines, such as history, economics and
                                geography? </li>
                            <li>How do the often deeply held nature of political beliefs and biases
                                affect the acquisition of knowledge in global politics? </li>
                            <li>How is political science distinct from the practice of
                                politics?</li>
                            <li>What are the benefits and difficulties of examining political issues
                                against the backdrop of a certain theoretical foundation or
                                ideology? </li>
                            <li>Why might the value of case studies as a method of acquiring
                                knowledge be considered questionable? </li>
                            <li>Can we have political beliefs or knowledge that are independent of
                                our cultures?</li>
                            <li>Why do some individuals believe that they know what is right for
                                others?</li>
                            <li>How do we decide between the opinions of experts when they disagree?
                                Who are the experts in global politics? </li>
                            <li>What is the role of communication and media in shaping people’s
                                perception of issues in global politics? </li>
                            <li>Is it ever justifiable to act without having good grounds or
                                evidence for doing so?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Global politics and creativity, activity, service</h4>
                        <p>An important characteristic of the global politics course is that
                            students examine the complex political issues of our time in a
                            contextual way. Due to the interconnectedness of the 21st-century world,
                            many global challenges manifest themselves in students’ local or
                            otherwise significant communities as powerfully as at national and
                            international levels. The ethos of the CAS programme is to engage
                            students in experiential learning in a similarly contextual way. </p>
                        <p>CAS and global politics can complement each other in a number of ways.
                            Learning about significant local and global issues in the global
                            politics course may give students new ideas for CAS experiences and/or
                            CAS projects. As a result of the knowledge and understanding students
                            develop about an issue and its potential solutions in the global
                            politics course, they might be able to investigate, plan, act, reflect
                            on, and demonstrate CAS experiences in a richer way. Similarly, CAS
                            experiences can ignite students’ passion for addressing a particular
                            issue in global politics. Students may decide to examine the political
                            dimension of an issue and its potential solutions in their global
                            politics class, or build an engagement activity on it, or utilize it as
                            a case study in their HL extension work. This cross-pollination of ideas
                            between CAS and global politics may improve students’ grasp of an issue
                            and its political dimensions and may also stimulate further CAS
                            experiences. </p>
                        <p>While CAS activities can both be informed by academic subjects and
                            inspire further learning in them, they must be distinct from activities
                            undertaken in the global politics course as part of DP assessment
                            requirements. This is particularly important with respect to the
                            potential overlap between CAS experiences and the engagement activity
                            undertaken for global politics. Where an activity is very large and
                            multi-faceted it may be that there is one element that could constitute
                            an appropriate engagement activity for global politics, and other
                            elements that could be appropriate as an activity for CAS. However the
                            same elements may <strong>not</strong> be counted for both global
                            politics and CAS. For example, a student participating in a Model United
                            Nations (MUN) simulation could nominate one particular element, such as
                            researching various political debating techniques, as his or her global
                            politics engagement, and nominate other elements of the MUN
                            participation, such as leading his or her school delegation, for CAS.
                            Similarly, a student involved in a youth initiative in the local
                            community could count examining the role of the community council in
                            such initiatives and canvassing the council’s support for this
                            particular project as his or her global politics engagement, while
                            documenting the participation in actual activities with youth could
                            count for CAS. </p>
                        <h4>Global politics and the extended essay</h4>
                        <p>An extended essay in global politics provides students with an
                            opportunity to undertake an in-depth analysis of a significant,
                            contemporary global political issue. Students should choose a topic that
                            will allow them to demonstrate their knowledge, research skills and
                            critical thinking skills leading to a substantial essay that utilizes
                            relevant key concepts, theoretical foundations and approaches of global
                            politics. The outcome of the research should be a coherent and
                            structured essay that effectively answers a specific research question. </p>
                        <p>Given the complexity of contemporary political issues, extended essays in
                            global politics are likely to draw on the knowledge and methodologies of
                            a range of social science subjects. Students must use relevant secondary
                            sources to substantiate their arguments and may supplement this with
                            appropriate primary sources. Various approaches to the research are
                            possible (such as case studies, comparative studies, analyses of
                            discourse), with relevant techniques chosen for gathering and
                            interpreting evidence (such as interviews, literature or media reviews,
                            quantitative data analysis). </p>
                        <p>As in their engagement activity and HL extension work, students examine
                            political issues in their extended essays. While this examination is
                            primarily based on experiential learning in the engagement activity and
                            culminates in an oral analysis in the HL extension, the extended essay
                            in global politics is a formal research essay. For example, students
                            interested in a more theoretical approach to political issues will find
                            the extended essay an excellent opportunity to examine the key concepts
                            of global politics in a way that is more anchored in academic debates.
                            Students with an interest in how quantitative data is used to underpin
                            decision-making or shape perceptions in global politics can undertake
                            comprehensive data analysis for their extended essay. The engagement
                            activity and the HL extension can give students ideas and inspiration
                            for their extended essays. However, students may <strong>not</strong>
                            examine the same political issue for their extended essay as they have
                            done for another assessment component. </p>

                        <h3>Global politics and international-mindedness</h3>
                        <p>Developing students’ awareness of multiple partial perspectives and
                            approaches—including their own—is at the heart of the global politics
                            course. The course encourages dialogue, discussion and debate. Nurturing
                            students’ capacity to listen to themselves and to others in order to
                            understand divergent opinions is important not only for interpreting
                            competing and contestable claims, but also for appreciating that
                            political beliefs and positions are contextual and deeply held by
                            individuals. By engaging in respectful and attentive dialogue,
                            discussion and debate, it is hoped that students would progress towards
                            forming their own, well-informed provisional viewpoints. They would be
                            better equipped to understand the hurdles of, and opportunities for,
                            political progress in the real world, to build relationships with others
                            and to resolve conflicts they may encounter in a peaceful way. </p>
                        <p>The global politics course aims to develop international-mindedness in
                            students through an examination of fundamental political concepts and
                            debates that have global significance. The course considers and
                            encourages contemporary examples and case studies at a variety of
                            levels, from local to global, while facilitating comparison between the
                            levels. Throughout the course, teachers have the opportunity to choose
                            relevant examples and case studies to ensure that the course
                            appropriately meets their students’ needs and interests, regardless of
                            their location or cultural context. </p>
                        <p>The course also enables students to reach an awareness and appreciation
                            of both their own civic responsibility at a local level and their shared
                            responsibility as citizens of an increasingly interconnected world. The
                            inclusion of an engagement activity in the course reflects the
                            importance given to not only appreciating and understanding the complex
                            issues facing the world today, but also of engaging with them in an
                            active and personal way. </p>

                        <h3>Engaging with sensitive topics</h3>
                        <p>Studying global politics allows the opportunity for students to engage
                            with exciting, stimulating and personally relevant topics and issues.
                            However it should be noted that often such topics and issues can also be
                            sensitive and personally or culturally challenging. Teachers should be
                            aware of this and provide guidance to students on how to approach and
                            engage with such topics in a responsible manner, providing due
                            cognizance to questions and issues of identity. Teachers should also
                            read carefully the ethical guidelines for the engagement activity
                            provided under Guide&gt;Syllabus&gt;Syllabus content&gt;Engagement

                            particular background in terms of specific subjects studied for national
                            or international qualifications is expected or required. The skills

                            group involves inquiry into historical, contemporary, geographical,
                            political, social, economic, religious, technological and cultural
                            contexts that influence and impact on people and communities’ lives and
                            environments. The MYP individuals and societies subject group therefore
                            provides a very useful foundation for students who go on to study the
                            Diploma Programme global politics course. </p>
                        <p>Key concepts encountered in MYP social sciences and humanities, such as
                            time, place and change are also encountered within the global politics

                            guide. Thus, studying global politics naturally extends the skills
                            developed in MYP individuals and societies subjects. Equally, students’
                            organization, collaboration, research and presentation strategies that
                            began in MYP humanities and social sciences will become more
                            sophisticated while undertaking the Diploma Programme global politics

                            Diploma Programme subjects, a core consisting of four components and a
                            career-related study. The subject of global politics can assist CP
                            students planning careers in, for example, the hospitality industry, the
                            technology industry, or international business. Global politics helps
                            students to understand the underlying mechanisms of the 21st century
                            world and to engage with current affairs. Students explore different
                            political, social and economic structures and practices leading to a
                            greater understanding of the world around them. Global politics
                            encourages the development of strong communication skills, critical
                            thinking, and ethical approaches that will assist students in the global

                        political concepts and contemporary political issues in a variety of
                        contexts and through a variety of approaches. The following diagram
                        illustrates the elements of the course. Through teaching and learning in the
                        subject, students develop a holistic and nuanced understanding of global
                        politics and acquire the skills needed to analyse, evaluate and act on
                        political issues they encounter inside and outside of the classroom. </p>

                    <h4>Political issues</h4>
                    <p>Politics are conventionally considered to be the actions taken in the
                        formation and maintenance of the state or other governing entity.
                        Traditional definitions assume, for example, that there are no politics
                        without that governing entity—so by those definitions, hunter-gatherer
                        societies do not have internal politics. With state formation, politics play
                        the role of maintaining the power of the state by the inclusion and
                        exclusion&#160;of peoples and competing formations that look to gain access
                        to resources and power. The goal of the state is to produce hegemony, a
                        stable agreement between ruling entities and civil society. A political
                        issue, under such a definition, would be any event or action that is in the
                        arena of state power and its maintenance. </p>
                    <p>More recently, however, and particularly with the onset of comprehensive
                        globalization, the terms “political” and “political issues” have taken on a
                        broader and more inclusive meaning. Over the last few decades, broad
                        transformations in global social organization and trends in scholarship have
                        contributed to a more nuanced understanding of the complexity of real-world
                        politics. Phenomena such as population growth, climate change, developments
                        in communication technology and changes in production patterns all transcend
                        the state and have facilitated the entry of new actors at various levels of
                        social organization. Research on the role of social movements, multinational
                        corporations and international institutions, to name just three examples,
                        has emphasized the profoundly political intent and impact of their actions.
                        Alongside states, communities and international bodies compete for resources
                        and are often confronted with new forms of power and influence from within
                        and outside their boundaries. The world around us has evolved in
                        unimaginable ways and academic scholarship provides us with the tools to
                        grapple with the myriad of ways in which politics are part of our everyday
                        lives. Consequently, the central unifying theme of the Diploma Programme
                        global politics course is “people, power and politics”. </p>
                    <p>In the global politics course, a <em>political issue</em> is any question
                        that deals with how power is distributed and how it operates within social
                        organization, and how people think about, and engage in, their communities
                        and the wider world on matters that affect their lives. Political issues are
                        researched in social science departments and think tanks; they populate the
                        agendas of politicians and policy-makers; they occupy the minds of
                        executives of global corporations and local social entrepreneurs; they
                        affect how people participate in and resist change; they are discussed in
                        media and over coffee; they inspire oratory and art; they are deeply rooted
                        in history and culture. Political issues are part of our daily lives. </p>
                    <p>Political issues can be found at various levels. Taking the example of the
                        issue of climate change, at the <strong>global level</strong>, the
                        discussion could focus on the degree to which the limited ability to enforce
                        legally binding action by the United Nations (UN) on its member nations
                        inhibits the world as a whole to make progress towards combating climate
                        change. At the <strong>international level</strong>, the debate could centre
                        on the fact that many developing countries have already experienced the
                        impact of climate change, and delineate how this affects their positions in
                        international climate negotiations. A political issue at the
                            <strong>regional level</strong> could be the challenges a regional
                        association of nations faces in formulating a common climate policy. A
                        political issue at the <strong>national level</strong> could be the impact
                        of a particularly strong typhoon on the central government’s decisions and
                        policies on disaster prevention. A political issue at the <strong>local
                            level</strong> could be the ways in which a typhoon on a particular
                        island has changed people’s dependency on outside assistance and the
                        society’s resulting power dynamics. A political issue at the
                            <strong>community level</strong> could be the mechanisms and the degree
                        to which migrant workers and emigrants are able to help support their
                        families and relatives in a post-disaster community. </p>
                    <p>Defining an interesting political issue in the wider, real-world situation
                        they are studying is often an early and key step for students to make
                        progress with their understanding of global politics. This is particularly
                        important in order to see the connections between the key concepts and
                        examples in the core units, to determine an appropriate reflective focus for
                        the engagement activity and to select a well-defined aspect of the HL case
                        studies for oral presentation. </p>
                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>Key concepts</h3>
                        <p>The following 16 key concepts weave a conceptual thread through the
                            course. They should be explored both when working with the four core
                            units, the engagement activity and the HL extension, in order to equip
                            students with a conceptual framework with which to access and understand
                            the political issues examined. </p>
                        <p>Brief explanations of the key concepts are given in the table below to
                            provide teachers and students with a starting point for their conceptual
                            journey of global politics. However, a few sentences could never capture
                            the different and contested interpretations of these big, important and
                            organizing ideas of the theory and practice of politics. A rich and
                            balanced understanding of the key concepts is a key aim and assessment
                            objective of the course and requires their examination from multiple
                            approaches and perspectives in a variety of contexts. </p>
                        <p>The concepts below are listed in the order in which they appear in the
                            core units, with four concepts attached to each unit. This unit
                            affiliation indicates where the concepts are most likely to surface, but
                            the intention is that any of them can and should be addressed at any
                            point of the course where they add value to the discussion. </p>

                                    change and, rather than being viewed as a unitary or independent
                                    force, is as an aspect of relations among people functioning

                                    in global politics. Some theorists argue that sovereign power is
                                    increasingly being eroded by aspects of globalization such as
                                    global communication and trade, which states cannot always fully
                                    control. Others argue that sovereign states exercise a great

                                    this is unlikely to change. </td>

                                    exercising power over others. The most accepted contemporary
                                    source of legitimacy in a state is some form of democracy or
                                    constitutionalism whereby the governed have a defined and
                                    periodical opportunity to choose who they wish to exercise power
                                    over them. Other sources of legitimacy are suggested in states

                                    refers to the mutual reliance between and among groups,
                                    organizations, geographic areas and/or states for access to
                                    resources that sustain living arrangements. Often, this mutual

                                    security dimension (such as defence arrangements) and,

                                    treaties). Globalization has increased interdependence, while
                                    often changing the relationships of power among the various

                                    argue that human rights are a Western, or at least culturally

                                    although what is meant by deserve is also contested. One avenue

                                    is often divided into positive and negative liberty, with

                                    and argue that in practice, one form of liberty cannot exist
                                    without the other. It is also questioned if such an

                                    world, in which the seeming freedom and autonomy of some may
                                    depend on lack of some forms of liberty for others. Hence,
                                    debates on equality inform our understanding of liberty as well.

                            and students; for many topics, local and current examples will be more
                            appropriate than the ones suggested in this guide, and many more
                            possible examples are listed than are expected to be covered during the
                            course. Teachers should exercise their judgment on when enough examples

                            additionally refer to specific theorists, actors, events etc. The
                            examples chosen illustrate a breadth of possibilities and are intended
                            to point towards some directions in which to take the inquiry. Again, it

                        <p>In the HL extension, students select two case studies through which they
                            explore global political challenges. Case studies provide an opportunity
                            for a much more in-depth study than the examples used throughout the
                            rest of the course.&#160;Please refer to Guide&gt;Syallabus&gt;Syllabus

                            context of the global politics course, is understood to refer to events
                            during the students’ lifetime. Historical examples can be used if they

                            understanding a topic and when they have clear implications for the
                            present—but the emphasis of the course should be on current affairs and
                            recent examples and case studies. Where historical examples are used,
                            they should only be mentioned and teaching should quickly move to
                            contemporary issues. </p>

                        <h3>Theoretical foundations</h3>
                        <p>The Diploma Programme global politics course draws on multiple
                            disciplines in the social sciences. Many theories and analytical
                            approaches have been put forward to further debates in these
                            disciplines. Consequently the course is rich in potential theoretical
                            foundations. Some examples of theoretical foundations that are likely to
                            be helpful throughout the course are provided below; however, different
                            or additional foundations may be relevant depending on the issue at
                            stake. </p>
                        <p>While the key concepts help students understand interrelated big ideas
                            behind specific political issues, theoretical foundations give students
                            some alternative interpretations of these big ideas advocated by various
                            camps of political debate across time and space. Theoretical
                            foundations, perhaps more so than the key concepts (which aim to capture
                            the essence of a particular aspect of political life) are contextual:
                            they are a product of the circumstances in which, and purposes for
                            which, they were developed, and they evolve. Consequently, only the very
                            central elements of each suggested theoretical foundation are given
                            below. </p>

                        <p>It is a central element of the global politics course that the key
                            political concepts and contemporary political issues are studied at a
                            number of levels: global, international, regional, national, local and
                            community. These levels help students to appreciate that what may
                            initially appear to be a global issue actually has many local
                            implications and vice versa, and that decision-making on the same
                            phenomenon may look quite different depending on whether it is analysed
                            on a systemic or sub-systemic level. The appropriate level of analysis
                            depends on the issue at stake and students’ objectives in a task. Brief

                                <td>The idea of community is one of the most debated concepts in the
                                    social sciences. Communities were once thought of as
                                    geographically based groups of people with similar interests,
                                    mutual support and cultural traits. The most commonly held view
                                    was that communities must include not only spatial and
                                    ecological definitions, but institutional and emotional ones.
                                    Recently, however, processes of globalization have led social
                                    scientists to rethink standard definitions. Advances in
                                    communication technologies allow similar interests to be
                                    nurtured beyond physical boundaries, and the definition of
                                    community has become intertwined with debates about
                                    globalization and the role and place of people within it. </td>

                        <h4>Individual and group perspectives</h4>
                        <p>Throughout the course, it is also necessary to approach the key political
                            concepts and contemporary political issues through various individual
                            and group perspectives. These help students to develop an appreciation
                            for multiple points of view and to deepen their understanding of the
                            complexity of many issues encountered in the study of global politics:
                            our unique personalities, life experiences and the social and cultural
                            environments of which we are a part influence how we act in global
                            politics. Three examples of important perspectives are gender, ethnicity
                            and religion; additional individual and group perspectives will be
                            relevant depending on the issue at stake. </p>
                        <h5>Gender</h5>
                        <p>
                            <em>Gender</em> is an important form of identity that can be socially
                            constructed as well as biologically determined. Gender values can also
                            change dramatically over time. In the 20th century, feminist movements
                            successfully drew attention to women’s inequality in education,
                            employment, the home and in politics, and these issues remain ever
                            pertinent. Today, <em>gender relations</em> in global politics refers to
                            contested and changing power relations between men and women in which
                            constructions of masculinity are often privileged. Many key aspects of
                            global politics such as human rights, development and conflict remain
                            highly gendered, and issues such as literacy, migration, sexual violence
                            and disease continue to impact on men, women and children differently. </p>
                        <h5>Ethnicity</h5>
                        <p>
                            <em>Ethnicity</em> is a form of identity in terms of membership of an
                            ethnic group. Individuals within an ethnic group share common
                            characteristics including cultural and societal similarities such as
                            language, beliefs and history. Although there may be no formal agreement
                            about what makes each ethnic identity unique, many people describe
                            themselves as descendents of a particular ethnic group and wish to
                            preserve this status and their rights. Categories based on ethnicity may
                            or may not overlap with national identities. </p>
                        <h5>Religion</h5>
                        <p>
                            <em>Religion</em> refers to a diverse set of belief systems. Religious
                            identity usually has both a personal and a social dimension. On one
                            hand, religion provides answers to questions about life, death, origins
                            of the world and so on, and is a way for individuals to find or generate
                            meaning in their own lives. On the other hand, members of a religion
                            share narratives, rituals and, often, social norms and a moral code;
                            being a member of the religious community is an important aspect of most
                            religions. The potency of both the personal and social dimensions of
                            religion combined with the fact that religions assert authority from
                            supernatural sources serves to strengthen the influence of religious
                            identities and communities in global politics. </p>

                        <h3>Core units: people, power and politics</h3>
                        <p>The common core for SL and HL students consists of four units. The first
                            unit can be perceived as the foundational unit for the other units, and
                            some treatment of it is likely to be desirable at the start of the
                            course. However, there is no expectation of a linear progression, and
                            topics within the course can be studied in any order. </p>
                        <p>Specific key concepts are tied to specific units to aid course planning
                            and to help create focus. However, given the connections between
                            political issues discussed in the different units, these concepts should
                            be addressed as natural in the progression of the course. </p>

                        <h3>Engagement activity</h3>
                        <p>The engagement activity provides students an opportunity to explore the
                            central unifying theme of the course—people, power and politics—in
                            practice and outside of the classroom. In the course of their engagement
                            activity, students may, for example, learn about the local
                            manifestations of a global issue, engage with primary sources and
                            experience the dynamics and consequences of decision-making on
                            individuals and communities. Although the emphasis of the task is on
                            active engagement rather than primarily on research, it is expected that
                            students make use of the key concepts, theories and ideas they are
                            learning in the classroom and undertake further reading to inform their
                            planning and actions, and their discussion of the political issue raised
                            in their activities. In brief, the task aims at active and reflective
                            engagement. The engagement activity work culminates in a 2,000-word
                            written report. More information on the assessment of the written report
                            is given in Guide&gt;Internal assessment. </p>
                        <p>There are three parts to the engagement activity work: undertaking an
                            engagement, doing complementary research and writing a report. Although
                            the written report is the assessed component of the engagement activity,
                            students’ planning, actions, further reading and discussion are
                            interconnected; all are required for a good end result. Moreover,
                            students can expect to go back and forth between the different elements
                            of the work: for example, they should do some preliminary research on
                            the context of their activities before they engage, and while writing
                            their report, they may discover areas for which additional research is
                            needed to balance the perspectives acquired through the engagement. </p>

                        <h4>Selecting appropriate engagements</h4>
                        <p>When selecting their engagements, it is central that students are able to
                            identify a clear political issue that the engagement allows them to
                            explore and that they develop an interest in this issue. The political
                            issue should be authentically embedded in the engagement, and students’
                            role in the engagement should be such that they truly learn about this
                            political issue through what they <strong>do</strong>. For example, if a
                            student suggests engaging in a beach clean-up, what they do is largely
                            apolitical; any political issues are likely to be artificially or
                            remotely connected to the activity. However, if a student proposes to
                            organize an awareness raising campaign for beach clean-ups, including
                            actually cleaning up a beach, many political issues are authentically
                            embedded in the engagement, such as comparison of the opportunities for
                            and limitations of citizen activism versus governmental responsibility
                            for such tasks. Furthermore, through selecting campaign means,
                            discussing these with the local council, executing the campaign and
                            organizing activities on the ground, the student learns about their
                            selected political issue first hand.</p>
                        <p> In other words, students should choose an engagement that helps them
                            gain an experiential perspective on a political issue that they are
                            genuinely interested in. Often, this is likely to happen if: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the engagement allows students to experience the dynamics of real
                                world politics and do so in a participatory way </li>
                            <li>the political issue focused upon affects a community or a society
                                that the student has some stake and experiences in </li>
                            <li>the engagement involves contact with others who are also interested
                                in, or have a stake in, the political issue. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Using the example of the beach clean-up, organizing an awareness raising
                            campaign for beach clean-ups is likely to help the student gain an
                            experiential perspective on the opportunities for and limitations of
                            citizen activism versus governmental responsibility for such tasks and
                            to be of genuine interest to the student <strong>because</strong> the
                            engagement is a collective effort around a real problem in the student’s
                            own locality. </p>
                        <p> This is not to say other kinds of engagements, such as political
                            simulations or activities centred on the lives of far-away people,
                            communities or societies, could not form the basis of a meaningful and
                            successful engagement activity as long as there is a significant
                            experiential element involved and as long as this element allows
                            students to gain an experiential perspective on a political issue they
                            are interested in. For example, a student interested in the political
                            issue of which techniques can be employed by parties with less power
                            versus those with more power in a negotiation situation can learn about
                            this effectively through a simulation. Similarly, a student interested
                            in the political issue of women’s rights in a different part of the
                            world can learn about this meaningfully through activities such as
                            becoming involved with a human rights NGO working with immigrant women
                            from that part of the world. </p>
                        <p> For reasons of possible bias, it is recommended that the engagement
                            should not consist of interviewing only one person. </p>
                        <p>The following are some further examples of the kinds of engagements and
                            political issues embedded in them that are likely to lend themselves
                            well to meaningful and successful engagement activities in global
                            politics. Teachers and students are free to choose their own topics and
                            the ones listed here should only serve as <strong>examples</strong>. </p>

                        <p>In the course of their global politics studies, students may be involved
                            with several activities that could qualify as engagements, and then
                            choose the most interesting and suitable activity to research and write
                            a report on. However, teachers should be mindful of directing students
                            and their time commitments so that other elements of their Diploma
                            Programme do not suffer. </p>
                        <p>HL students may tie their engagement activity to a global political
                            challenge an aspect of which they have examined in their HL case
                            studies, but must not study the same political issue. </p>
                        <h4>Complementary research</h4>
                        <p>The role of research in the engagement activity is to complement what
                            students learn through their engagement, including their own evolving
                            beliefs and perspectives. A helpful way of thinking about research is to
                            ask: in addition to the experiential learning students gain and on which
                            they critically reflect, what else do they need to know and understand
                            to be able to write a good, evaluative analysis of their selected
                            political issue? Often, background information on actors, organizations,
                            events and so on is required for understanding the context in which the
                            engagement takes place. Some additional reading to establish links
                            between their activities, chosen political issue and the key concepts,
                            theories and ideas studied in the core units of the course is called
                            for. Also, the perspectives students gain through their engagement are
                            partial and limited. Research is needed to establish which other
                            perspectives on the political issue and the organization(s) with which
                            students have been engaging are possible, and what the strengths and
                            limitations of various perspectives are. </p>
                        <p>Following through with the example of organizing an awareness raising
                            campaign for beach clean-ups, the role of research in this engagement
                            activity could be to compare the results of the student’s campaign with
                            other similar clean-up campaigns, read up on what political factors
                            might explain the success of citizenship activism in the culture and
                            society in question, and study the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of
                            citizen activism versus governmental measures in achieving collective
                            goods like clean beaches. </p>
                        <p>Students’ complementary research can be based on primary and secondary
                            material, though the emphasis is likely to be on secondary sources, as
                            any primary research is likely to be a part of the engagement itself.
                            During their experiential learning, students may collect items such as
                            photos, responses to questionnaires and extracts of interviews.
                            Newspaper, magazine and journal articles, textbooks, carefully selected
                            websites, images and audio-visual material are all legitimate secondary
                            sources. It is expected that students will include in-text citations or
                            references of the supporting documents and a bibliography, which should
                            be structured in a recognized academic format. Primary sources
                            significant to the students’ discussion should be included in an
                            appendix, where appropriate. </p>
                        <p>Teachers should be mindful that the main focus of the task is on active
                            engagement rather than the type of extensive research students conduct
                            for, say, their extended essay. Again, the role of the research is to
                            enhance students’ understanding of the political issue raised by their
                            engagement and help them answer questions that emerge as a result of
                            their planning, actions and discussion. </p>
                        <h4>Written report</h4>
                        <p>The written report is an opportunity for students to bring together the
                            lessons they have learned about their chosen political issue through
                            their engagement and complementary research. As for many other larger
                            writing projects, it is likely to be highly helpful for students to
                            formulate a question, tightly linked to the political issue, which they
                            attempt to answer through their experiences and reading, and refine this
                            question throughout the engagement activity process. </p>
                        <p>In their reports, students must identify a political issue they decided
                            to explore through the engagement and explain their reasons why they
                            wanted to get involved with this specific engagement and issue. If the
                            engagement is large and multi-faceted—perhaps consisting of several
                            tasks or with the student having several roles in the course of the
                            engagement—they need to focus their report on aspects of the engagement
                            that are most relevant for their treatment of the political issue.
                            Instead of describing at length what they did, the key aspect about the
                            engagement in the written report is what it taught students about their
                            selected political issue. The lessons from experiential learning,
                            combined with insights from research, inform students’ analysis of the
                            political issue. They are expected to synthesise their insights and
                            evaluate the political issue from multiple perspectives. </p>
                        <p>There is no specific format required of the written report, but is it
                            expected that the report is a structured piece of well-presented
                            writing. </p>
                        <h4>Word count</h4>
                        <p>The written report must not exceed 2,000 words. Work which falls
                            significantly below 2,000 words is unlikely to fully meet the stated
                            requirements of the task, and is likely to receive low marks. A word
                            count must be included as part of the report. If the word limit is
                            exceeded the teacher’s assessment must be based on the first 2,000
                            words. </p>

                        <h4>Teacher guidance</h4>
                        <p>With the teacher’s support, students should choose an engagement.</p>
                        <p>The teacher should approve the students’ engagement and political issue
                            before work is started, to ensure that these are suitable and allow
                            access to all levels of the assessment criteria. It is highly advisable
                            that every student is supplied with a copy of the assessment criteria. </p>
                        <p>It is particularly important for teachers to take an active role in
                            guiding students’ choice of engagement in order to ensure that they are
                            able to identify a political issue that can be explored through what
                            students suggest to <strong>do</strong> and that they are genuinely
                            interested in this political issue. </p>
                        <p>The teacher should also guide students in the relevance and sufficiency
                            of their research.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the engagement activity process, students and the teacher
                            should engage in dialogue supportive of the students’ work. The teacher
                            may comment on students’ plans, including the scope of their research,
                            and the first draft of the written report as part of the learning
                            process. </p>
                        <h4>Ethical guidelines for the engagement activity </h4>
                        <p>Students must adhere to the following global politics course ethical
                            guidelines when undertaking their engagement activity. They must show
                            tact and sensitivity, respect confidentiality and acknowledge all
                            sources used. </p>

                                involving children need the written consent of parent(s) or
                                guardian(s), and students must ensure that parents are fully
                                informed about the nature of the activity. Where an activity is
                                conducted with children in a school, the written consent of the
                                teachers concerned must also be obtained. </li>
                            <li>Students must avoid conducting research with any adult who is not in

                            <li>Any activity which creates anxiety, stress, pain or discomfort for
                                participants must not be permitted. </li>
                            <li>Participants and interviewees must be debriefed and given the right
                                to withdraw their own personal data and responses. Anonymity for
                                each participant must be guaranteed, except for interviewees in an
                                elected or appointed government role or in a formal non-state actor
                                role. </li>
                            <li>Acknowledging that some interviewees may not be in a position to or
                                may not choose to respond to questions freely and independently,
                                students should, when suspecting this to be the case, complement
                                their primary research with other opinions. </li>
                            <li>Using relatives as a source in the engagement activity is not
                                advisable, but if students should choose to do so, this must be
                                declared. </li>
                            <li>Teachers and students should exercise sensitivity to local and
                                international cultures.</li>
                            <li>Students must not falsify or make up data.</li>
                            <li>Activities that are conducted online are subject to the same
                                guidelines. Any data collected online must be deleted once the
                                research is complete. Such data must not be used for any purpose
                                other than the completion of the engagement activity. </li>
                            <li>Students found to have carried out unethical work will be awarded no
                                marks for the engagement activity component. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Links to creativity, activity, service</h4>
                        <p>It is possible that there may be links between the engagement activity
                            chosen by students and an activity undertaken by them for CAS. This is
                            an ideal opportunity for students to make such links between CAS and
                            their academic studies. However it should be noted that although CAS
                            activities can be both inspired and informed by components of academic
                            subjects, CAS activities must still be distinct from activities
                            undertaken as part of Diploma Programme assessment requirements. </p>
                        <p>Where an activity is very large and multi-faceted it may be that there is
                            one element which could constitute an appropriate engagement for global
                            politics, and other elements which could be appropriate as activity for
                            CAS. However the same elements may <strong>not</strong> be counted for
                            both global politics and CAS. For example, a student participating in a
                            Model United Nations (MUN) simulation could nominate one particular
                            element, such as researching various political debating techniques, as
                            their global politics engagement, and nominate other elements of their
                            MUN participation, such as leading their school delegation, for CAS.
                            Similarly, a student involved in a youth initiative in the local
                            community could count examining the role of the community council in
                            empowering youth and canvassing their support for this particular
                            project as their global politics engagement, while documenting the
                            participation in actual activities with youth for CAS. </p>

                        <h3>HL extension: global political challenges</h3>
                        <p>The HL extension gives students the opportunity to explore important
                            global political challenges through a case studies approach. HL students
                            must study <strong>two</strong> of the following six topics. </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Environment</li>
                            <li>Poverty</li>
                            <li>Health</li>
                            <li>Identity</li>
                            <li>Borders </li>
                            <li>Security</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>There is no additional prescribed content for the HL extension. For each
                            of the two topics chosen students must undertake a detailed case study,
                            culminating in a 10-minute video recorded oral presentation. These case
                            studies provide an opportunity for students to conduct an in-depth
                            analysis of complex political issues in real-life situations. The
                            approach also familiarizes students with the case study as an important
                            method of gaining knowledge in the social sciences and allows them to
                            practice skills considered important for students of the politics
                            subject area, such as research and presentation skills. More information
                            on the assessment of the oral presentation is given in Guide&gt;Internal
                            assessment. </p>
                        <p>There are three components to the HL extension work: researching the case
                            studies, preparing to present them and actually presenting them. While
                            students’ research may start from broad ideas related to the selected
                            global political challenges, students should gradually narrow down their
                            focus on particular case studies and political issues that can be
                            effectively explored in the course of 10-minute presentations. 10
                            minutes per case study is a short time, and it is the quality of the
                            preceding research and presentation preparation that determines how well
                            this time is utilized. </p>

                        <h4>Researching the case study</h4>
                        <p>The case study selected for each chosen topic should allow for a thorough
                            and detailed exploration of a global political challenge, in a
                            particular real-life situation. The free choice of case studies is
                            intended to allow students to explore political issues that they find
                            particularly interesting or particularly revealing. It may be that
                            students wish to explore local cases, or cases that are otherwise of
                            particular personal interest. </p>
                        <p>Each case study selected and the political issue investigated therein
                            should be contemporary, clearly relevant and explicitly linked to one of
                            the global challenges listed as well as to the core units of the course.
                            Students should ask themselves how each case they suggest to investigate
                            relates to the wider context of global politics and how they can bring
                            the knowledge and understanding they have gained elsewhere in the course
                            to bear on the cases. The political issue selected for exploration
                            should be focused and specific. For example: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>rather than a broad topic such as “water supply”, an appropriate
                                case study and political issue would be “the 2011 drought and the
                                Yangtze river in China—viability of China’s water diversion plans” </li>
                            <li>rather than a broad topic such as “terrorism”, an appropriate case
                                study and political issue would be “the 2008 Mumbai
                                bombings—motivations for terrorism in India”. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following list indicates questions students should explore during
                            their research. While researching, they should already be thinking about
                            connections between the discrete pieces of information they collect so
                            as to build towards an oral presentation. </p>

                        <p>Students’ research can be based on primary and secondary material, though
                            the emphasis is likely to be on secondary sources. Newspaper, magazine
                            and journal articles, textbooks, carefully selected websites, images and
                            audio-visual materials are all legitimate secondary sources. Good
                            research practice requires that the sources represent a balance of
                            views. </p>
                        <p>A coversheet for each presentation must be submitted along with the
                            recording. The coversheet includes a bibliography. All sources used in
                            preparation of the presentation must be included in the bibliography. </p>
                        <h4>Preparing for presenting the case study</h4>
                        <p>Once they have completed sufficient research into the case and their
                            selected political issue, students should think about how they are going
                            to present their case study. For each case study, a 10-minute oral
                            presentation, which is recorded as a video, is prepared. </p>
                        <p>The structure and format of the presentation are not prescribed.
                            Therefore, students should plan carefully and creatively how they will
                            best engage their audience. In planning their presentations, students
                            should bear in mind that in addition to research skills, the HL
                            extension aims to develop their skills to deliver a thought-provoking
                            and informative presentation to a professional audience.&#160;In the
                            real world, professionals may not base their presentations around a set
                            of research prompts such as those given above; rather, they would
                            attempt to create an original and creative delivery of their arguments.
                            With this in mind, students are encouraged not to use the given
                            questions for research as a set structure for their presentation.
                            Clearly the presentation needs to address the more factual aspects of
                            the case, but this should occur when pertinent to understanding the
                            political issue rather than as a list at the beginning of the
                            presentation. Given the objectives of the task and the assessment
                            criteria, the structure and format chosen should be such that the
                            presentation is centred on analysis and evaluation of the case and the
                            political issue. This includes establishing clear links to the core
                            units and reflecting on the wider implications of the case. </p>
                        <p>Students should be particularly wary of the pitfall of focusing on the
                            historical aspects of the case; the analysis and evaluation should
                            concentrate on contemporary aspects of the political issue. </p>
                        <p>The following general questions are likely to be helpful for students’
                            preparations.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How will I set the stage?</li>
                            <li>Which points and perspectives do I want to communicate?</li>
                            <li>How will I conclude?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>As for many other larger pieces of work, it is likely to be helpful for
                            them to formulate a central question, closely linked to their chosen
                            political issue that they attempt to answer in the course of their
                            presentation. </p>
                        <p>A coversheet for each presentation must be submitted along with the
                            recording. The coversheet includes a written outline of the
                            presentation. </p>
                        <p>Visual aids, such as PowerPoint slides, are only permitted for showing
                            visual information (for example, tables, diagrams, maps, photos) and
                            should be carefully employed only when they enhance the argument or
                            audience engagement. Students may use limited notes or prompt cards when
                            delivering their presentations, but the content may not be written out
                            and read aloud. </p>
                        <h4>Teacher guidance</h4>
                        <p>Although it is recognized that the teacher and students are likely to
                            have several one-to-one interactions during the HL extension work, two
                            individual meetings on each of students’ case studies are prescribed:
                            one before students start researching their case study and another
                            before they start preparing for presenting it. Students note down the
                            outcomes of these meetings on a coversheet submitted along with the
                            recording of each presentation. The content of these individual meetings
                            is flexible, but the following teacher guidance is expected. </p>
                        <p>With the teacher’s support, students should choose two case studies of
                            two global political challenges. </p>
                        <p>The teacher should approve students’ choice of case studies before work
                            is started, to ensure that they are suitable for investigation and allow
                            access to all levels of the marking rubric. It is highly advisable that
                            every student is supplied with a copy of the marking rubric. Teacher
                            help is particularly valuable at this early stage, when students
                            identify their political issues, the ways in which the cases they
                            suggest to investigate are instances of global political challenges and
                            how they tie into the core units. The teacher should also guide students
                            in selection of appropriate sources. </p>
                        <p>Throughout the case study work, students and the teacher should engage in
                            dialogue supportive of students’ work. The teacher should help students
                            in, and provide feedback on, development of their presentation skills
                            and discuss with students their ideas for how to present their case
                            studies. </p>
                        <p>The teacher may comment once on students’ written outline for each
                            presentation but may not edit it. </p>
                        <p>Each presentation may only be performed once for the video recording. </p>
                        <h4>Topic 1: Environment</h4>
                        <p>This topic provides an opportunity to explore political issues connected
                            to the environment through a case studies approach. </p>
                        <p>Many of the topics, political issues and key concepts encountered in the
                            core units of the course are also central to discussions of the
                            environment. Many environmental problems transcend national boundaries,
                            and the activities of one country can have direct impact on multiple
                            countries. Mitigation of, and responses to, climate change and other
                            such global environmental challenges involve and require international
                            political cooperation and action. The use of natural resources in the
                            face of growing populations and increasingly resource-heavy lifestyles
                            across the globe raises many political issues—and is increasingly a
                            source of political tensions. The compatibility of economic growth and
                            sustainable development is debated at all levels of politics. </p>

                        <h4>Topic 2: Poverty</h4>
                        <p>This topic provides an opportunity to explore political issues connected
                            to poverty through a case studies approach. </p>
                        <p>Many of the topics, political issues and key concepts encountered in the
                            four core units of the course are also central to discussions of
                            poverty; for example, the impact of globalization and economic
                            integration on poverty, or cooperation between states and non-state
                            actors in initiatives to address poverty. There are particularly strong
                            links to the unit on development, with its emphasis on the concept of
                            inequality. However, experience of poverty can also be approached from a
                            human rights perspective, and poverty plays a significant role in some
                            conflicts. </p>

                        <p>This topic provides an opportunity to explore political issues connected
                            to identity through a case studies approach. </p>
                        <p>Many of the topics, political issues and key concepts encountered in the
                            four core units of this course are also central to discussions of
                            identity. In a more interconnected, complex world, people become
                            arguably more conscious of, and interested in, their own identity, also
                            in ways that have political implications. For example, since 9/11 there
                            has been increased attention on the significance of cultural and
                            religious identity in global politics. Women and ethnic minorities’
                            identity can be similarly political, with debates in many societies
                            about the appropriate line between the private and public spheres of
                            life. The media coverage of treatment of cases of genocide and ethnic
                            violence in institutions of international justice point towards the role
                            identity can play in some of the most horrific conflicts of recent
                            times. There are particularly strong links between this topic and the
                            unit on human rights. </p>

                        <h4>Topic 5: Borders</h4>
                        <p>This topic provides an opportunity to explore political issues connected
                            to borders through a case studies approach. </p>
                        <p>Many of the topics, political issues and key concepts encountered in the
                            four core units of this course are also central to discussions of
                            borders. Borders may be physical borders between countries, but they can
                            also be less concrete but equally influential borders of, say, social
                            class, ethnicity or gender. Sometimes, it is not the existence of
                            borders that is problematic, but rather a lack thereof, such as could be
                            argued in the case of cross-border movement of capital or treatment of
                            labour. Migration is closely linked to the concept of globalization, as
                            physical borders between nations are increasingly reduced. Immigration
                            is a controversial and topical issue in many countries, and political
                            backlashes to immigration on the face of changing and unstable economic
                            conditions are widespread. Many conflicts have a dimension that has to
                            do with borders of various kinds, and often human rights are violated in
                            crossing borders, as for example, in human trafficking. </p>

                            to security through a case studies approach. </p>
                        <p>Many of the topics, political issues and key concepts encountered in the

                            security. For example, discussions of sovereignty, military power, wars
                            between and within states, arms proliferation and the activities of
                            non-state actors all have clear links to security. There are
                            particularly strong links between this topic and the unit on peace and
                            conflict. However, security also has cultural, social and economic
                            dimensions. Issues such as food, water and energy security are
                            developing increasingly concrete ramifications in global politics. Human
                            rights violations can be viewed as attacks on individuals’ fundamental
                            sense of security. Furthermore, in an uncertain world, political actors
                            may sometimes try to benefit from people’s sense of insecurity. </p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>General</h3>
                        <p>Assessment is an integral part of teaching and learning. The most
                            important aims of assessment in the Diploma Programme are that it should
                            support curricular goals and encourage appropriate student learning.
                            Both external and internal assessments are used in the Diploma
                            Programme. IB&#160;examiners mark work produced for external assessment,
                            while work produced for internal assessment is marked by teachers and
                            externally moderated by the&#160;IB. </p>
                        <p>There are two types of assessment identified by the IB.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Formative assessment informs both teaching and learning. It is
                                concerned with providing accurate and helpful feedback to students
                                and teachers on the kind of learning taking place and the nature of
                                students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to help develop
                                students’ understanding and capabilities. Formative assessment can
                                also help to improve teaching quality, as it can provide information
                                to monitor progress towards meeting the course aims and objectives. </li>
                            <li>Summative assessment gives an overview of previous learning and is
                                concerned with measuring student achievement. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The Diploma Programme primarily focuses on summative assessment designed
                            to record student achievement at, or towards the end of, the course of
                            study. However, many of the assessment instruments can also be used
                            formatively during the course of teaching and learning, and teachers are
                            encouraged to do this. A comprehensive assessment plan is viewed as
                            being integral with teaching, learning and course organization. For
                            further information, see the section “Programme standards and practices
                            with requirements for the Diploma Programme” in the IB document
                                <em>Programme standards and practices</em> (2014). </p>
                        <p>The approach to assessment used by the IB is criterion-related, not
                            norm-referenced. This approach to assessment judges students’ work by
                            their performance in relation to identified levels of attainment, and
                            not in relation to the work of other students. For further information
                            on assessment within the Diploma Programme please refer to the
                            publication <em>Diploma Programme assessment: Principles and practice
                            </em>(2004, updated 2010). </p>

                        <h3>Methods of assessment</h3>
                        <p>The IB uses several methods to assess work produced by students.</p>
                        <div class="section">
                            <h4>Assessment criteria</h4>
                            <p>Assessment criteria are used when the assessment task is open-ended.
                                Each criterion concentrates on a particular skill that students are
                                expected to demonstrate. An assessment objective describes what
                                students should be able to do, and assessment criteria describe how
                                well they should be able to do it. Using assessment criteria allows
                                discrimination between different answers and encourages a variety of
                                responses. Each criterion comprises a set of hierarchically ordered
                                level descriptors. Each level descriptor is worth one or more marks.
                                Each criterion is applied independently using a best-fit model. The
                                maximum marks for each criterion may differ according to the
                                criterion’s importance. The marks awarded for each criterion are
                                added together to give the total mark for the piece of work. </p>

                            <p>Markbands are a comprehensive statement of expected performance
                                against which responses are judged. They represent a single holistic
                                criterion divided into level descriptors. Each level descriptor
                                corresponds to a range of marks to differentiate student
                                performance. A best-fit approach is used to ascertain which
                                particular mark to use from the possible range for each level
                                descriptor. </p>

                        <h3>Acknowledging the ideas or work of another person</h3>
                        <p>Coordinators and teachers are reminded that candidates must acknowledge
                            all sources used in work submitted for assessment. The following is
                            intended as a clarification of this requirement. </p>
                        <p>Diploma Programme candidates submit work for assessment in a variety of
                            media that may include audio-visual material, text, graphs, images
                            and/or data published in print or electronic sources. If a candidate
                            uses the work or ideas of another person, the candidate must acknowledge
                            the source using a standard style of referencing in a consistent manner.
                            A candidate’s failure to acknowledge a source will be investigated by
                            the IB as a potential breach of regulations that may result in a penalty
                            imposed by the IB final award committee. </p>
                        <p>The IB does not prescribe which style(s) of referencing or in-text
                            citation should be used by candidates; this is left to the discretion of
                            appropriate faculty/staff in the candidate’s school. The wide range of
                            subjects, three response languages and the diversity of referencing
                            styles make it impractical and restrictive to insist on particular
                            styles. In practice, certain styles may prove most commonly used, but
                            schools are free to choose a style that is appropriate for the subject
                            concerned and the language in which candidates’ work is written.
                            Regardless of the reference style adopted by the school for a given
                            subject, it is expected that the minimum information given includes:
                            name of author, date of publication, title of source, and page numbers
                            as applicable. </p>
                        <p>Candidates are expected to use a standard style and use it consistently
                            so that credit is given to all sources used, including sources that have
                            been paraphrased or summarized. When writing text a candidate must
                            clearly distinguish between their words and those of others by the use
                            of quotation marks (or other method, such as indentation) followed by an
                            appropriate citation that denotes an entry in the bibliography. If an
                            electronic source is cited, the date of access must be indicated.
                            Candidates are not expected to show faultless expertise in referencing,
                            but are expected to demonstrate that all sources have been acknowledged.
                            Candidates must be advised that audio-visual material, text, graphs,
                            images and/or data published in print or in electronic sources that is
                            not their own must also attribute the source. Again, an appropriate
                            style of referencing/citation must be used. </p>

                        <h3>Inclusive assessment arrangements</h3>
                        <p>Inclusive assessment arrangements are available for candidates with
                            assessment access requirements.&#160; These arrangements enable

                        <p>The IB document <em>Candidates with assessment access requirements</em>
                            (2009) provides details on all the inclusive assessment arrangements
                            available to candidates with learning support requirements. The IB
                            document <em>Learning diversity within the International Baccalaureate

                                Baccalaureate programmes</em> (2010) outlines the position of the IB
                            with regard to candidates with diverse learning needs in the IB
                            programmes. For candidates affected by adverse circumstances, the IB
                            documents <em>General regulations: Diploma Programme</em> (2014) and the
                                <em>Handbook of procedures for the Diploma Programme</em> provide
                            details on access consideration. </p>

                        <h3>Command terms</h3>
                        <p>Command terms are used in examination questions to indicate depth of
                            treatment. They are classified according to assessment objective levels. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Assessment objective level 1 (AO1): Knowledge and understanding</li>
                            <li>Assessment objective level 2 (AO2): Application and analysis</li>
                            <li>Assessment objective level 3 (AO3): Synthesis and evaluation</li>
                            <li>Assessment objective level 4 (AO4): Use and application of
                                appropriate skills </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There is a progression in demand from AO1 to AO3, while AO4 terms are
                            specific to particular skills. </p>
                        <p>Teachers and students must be familiar with these terms in order to
                            understand the depth of treatment required in examination questions. </p>
                        <p>Examination questions may use any command term from the assessment
                            objective level specified in the description of the assessment
                            component, or a less demanding command term from a lower level. For
                            example, if the assessment objective level for a component is AO2, an
                            examination question could contain any of the command terms for AO2,
                            such as “explain”, “distinguish”, “interpret” and so on. Alternatively,
                            the examination question could contain a command term from AO1, such as
                            “describe”. However, a more demanding command term such as “evaluate”,
                            from a higher classification (AO3 in this case), cannot be used. </p>
                        <p>The command terms used in the global politics course within each
                            assessment objective level are listed in alphabetical order below. In
                            the global politics course, the use and application of appropriate
                            skills is demonstrated as an integrated part of students’ answers and
                            hence AO4 command terms are not used in examination questions. </p>
                        <p>Definitions of these command terms are listed in
                            Guide&gt;Appendices&gt;Glossary of command terms. </p>

                            <p class="DefaultText">This paper is an essay paper, with two questions
                                set on each of the four core units. At least one of the questions
                                for each unit is firmly anchored in that unit, whereas the second
                                question may open up for a more cross-unit approach. </p>
                            <p>Conceptual understanding and ability to work with the key concepts of
                                the course is particularly important in this paper. Some questions
                                use the key concepts of that particular unit. Still other questions
                                draw on key concepts from several units. Even where the key concepts
                                are not explicitly mentioned in a question, students should
                                demonstrate a conceptual understanding of global politics. In their
                                answers, students are invited to draw on their understanding of any
                                relevant political concepts, depending on the arguments they put
                                forward. </p>
                            <p>Marks are awarded for demonstrating understanding of relevant
                                political concepts and prescribed content, making reference to
                                specific relevant examples, justifying points and exploring and
                                evaluating counterclaims, or different views on the question. </p>
                            <p>The same paper is set at both SL and HL. SL students must answer
                                    <strong>two</strong> questions, each selected from a
                                    <strong>different</strong> core unit. HL students must answer
                                    <strong>three</strong> questions, each selected from a
                                    <strong>different</strong> core unit. </p>
                            <p>The maximum mark for this paper is 50 marks at SL and 75 marks at HL.
                                The paper is marked using generic markbands and a paper-specific
                                markscheme. The questions in this paper assess objectives AO1–AO4,
                                and questions are set using AO3 command terms. </p>

                        <h3>Purpose of internal assessment</h3>
                        <p>Internal assessment is an integral part of the course and is compulsory
                            for both SL and HL students. It enables students to demonstrate the
                            application of their skills and knowledge, and to pursue their personal
                            interests, without the time limitations and other constraints that are
                            associated with written examinations. </p>
                        <p>The internal assessment requirements of global politics at SL and at HL
                            are briefly as follows. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>At SL and HL, students undertake an engagement through which they
                                explore a political issue of personal interest experientially. They
                                then produce a written report, in which they explain what they
                                learned about the political issue through the engagement, and
                                analyse and evaluate the issue, supported by additional
                                complementary research. </li>
                            <li>At HL, students additionally conduct in-depth research into two case
                                studies of two global political challenges and prepare an oral
                                presentation on chosen political issues in the case studies. The
                                presentations are video recorded. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>More information on the content of the internal assessment tasks is given
                            in Guide&gt;Syllabus&gt;Syllabus content. </p>

                        <h3>Time allocation</h3>
                        <p>Internal assessment is an integral part of the global politics course,
                            contributing 25% to the final assessment in the SL course and 40% to the
                            final assessment in the HL course. </p>
                        <p>It is recommended that a total of approximately 20 hours of teaching time
                            should be allocated to the engagement activity at SL and HL. This should
                            include time for: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the teacher to explain to students the requirements of the
                                engagement activity and the ethical guidelines for the engagement
                                activity </li>
                            <li>students to work on the engagement activity and ask questions</li>

                            <li>reviewing and monitoring progress, and checking authenticity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The teaching time allocated for the HL extension work is 90 hours. This
                            includes time for: </p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>the whole class to familiarize themselves with the six global
                                political challenges</li>

                        <h3>Guidance and authenticity</h3>
                        <p>The written report submitted for the engagement activity at SL and HL and
                            the video recorded presentations submitted for the HL extension must be
                            the student’s own work. However, it is not the intention that students
                            should decide upon a title or topic and be left to work on the internal
                            assessment components without any further support from the teacher. The
                            teacher should play an important role during both the planning stage and
                            the period when the student is working on the internally assessed work.
                            It is the responsibility of the teacher to ensure that students are
                            familiar with: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>the requirements of the type of work to be internally assessed</li>
                            <li>the ethical guidelines for the engagement activity at SL and HL</li>
                            <li>the assessment criteria for the engagement activity at SL and HL and
                                the marking rubric for the HL extension; students must understand
                                that the work submitted for assessment must address the criteria and
                                the rubric effectively. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Teachers and students must discuss the internally assessed work. Students
                            should be encouraged to initiate discussions with the teacher to obtain
                            advice and information, and students must not be penalized for seeking
                            guidance. As part of the learning process, teachers should read and give
                            advice to students on one draft of the written report for the engagement
                            activity and on one draft of the written outline for each HL
                            presentation. The teacher should provide oral or written advice on how
                            the work could be improved, but not edit the draft or the outline. For
                            the written report for the engagement activity, the next version handed
                            to the teacher must be the final version for submission; for the HL
                            extension, each presentation must only be performed once, for the video
                            recording. </p>
                        <p>It is the responsibility of teachers to ensure that all students
                            understand the basic meaning and significance of concepts that relate to
                            academic honesty, especially authenticity and intellectual property.
                            Teachers must ensure that all student work for assessment is prepared
                            according to the requirements and must explain clearly to students that
                            the internally assessed work must be entirely their own. Where
                            collaboration between students is permitted, it must be clear to all
                            students what the difference is between collaboration and collusion. </p>
                        <p>All work submitted to the IB for moderation or assessment must be
                            authenticated by a teacher, and must not include any known instances of
                            suspected or confirmed academic misconduct. Each student must confirm
                            that the work is his or her authentic work and constitutes the final
                            version of that work. Once a student has officially submitted the final
                            version of the work, it cannot be retracted. The requirement to confirm
                            the authenticity of work applies to the work of all students, not just
                            the sample work that will be submitted to the IB for the purpose of
                            moderation. For further details refer to the IB publications
                                <em>Academic honesty</em>, <em> The Diploma Programme: From
                                principles into practice</em> and the relevant articles in
                                <em>General regulations: Diploma Programme</em>. </p>
                        <p>Authenticity may be checked by discussion with the student on the content
                            of the work, and scrutiny of one or more of the following. </p>

                        <p>Students are required to write a maximum 2,000-word written report in
                            which they explain what they learned about their chosen political issue

                            the same at both SL and HL. The maximum mark for the written report is
                            20 marks and it is assessed using assessment criteria. </p>

                            <h4>Using assessment criteria </h4>
                            <p>For the engagement activity, a number of assessment criteria have
                                been identified. Each assessment criterion has level descriptors
                                describing specific achievement levels, together with an appropriate
                                range of marks. The level descriptors concentrate on positive
                                achievement, although for the lower levels failure to achieve may be
                                included in the description. </p>
                            <p>Teachers must judge the written report at SL and at HL against the
                                criteria using the level descriptors. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The same assessment criteria are provided for SL and HL.</li>
                                <li>The aim is to find, for each criterion, the descriptor that
                                    conveys most accurately the level attained by the student, using
                                    the best-fit model. A best-fit approach means that compensation
                                    should be made when a piece of work matches different aspects of
                                    a criterion at different levels. The mark awarded should be one
                                    that most fairly reflects the balance of achievement against the
                                    criterion. It is not necessary for every single aspect of a
                                    level descriptor to be met for that mark to be awarded. </li>
                                <li>When assessing a student’s work, teachers should read the level
                                    descriptors for each criterion until they reach a descriptor
                                    that most appropriately describes the level of the work being
                                    assessed. If a piece of work seems to fall between two
                                    descriptors, both descriptors should be read again and the one
                                    that more appropriately describes the student’s work should be
                                    chosen. </li>
                                <li>Where there are two or more marks available within a level,
                                    teachers should award the upper marks if the student’s work
                                    demonstrates the qualities described to a great extent; the work
                                    may be close to achieving marks in the level above. Teachers
                                    should award the lower marks if the student’s work demonstrates
                                    the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work may be
                                    close to achieving marks in the level below. </li>
                                <li>Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, (fractions

                                <p>HL students are required to present an oral analysis of selected
                                    political issues in <strong> two</strong> case studies of
                                        <strong>two</strong> global political challenges that they
                                    have researched in depth. The two, maximum 10-minute-long
                                    presentations are video recorded. The maximum mark for each
                                    presentation is 10 marks, and so the maximum mark for this
                                    component is 20 marks. The presentations are assessed using a
                                    global impression marking rubric. </p>

                        <h3>Using a global impression marking rubric </h3>
                        <p>For the HL extension, a global impression marking rubric has been
                            developed around the following overarching question. </p>
                        <p>“Does the student present a clear, focused and balanced analysis of the
                            case study, highlighting a global political challenge?” </p>
                        <p>The assessment of the presentations is a process of holistic or global
                            judgment around this overarching question rather than an analytical
                            process of totalling the assessment of separate criteria. The rubric has
                            five level descriptors describing specific achievement levels, allowing
                            for variation in student performance across different aspects of the
                            presentations. Because of the requirement for a reasonable mark range
                            along which to differentiate student performance, each level descriptor
                            corresponds to a range of two different marks. </p>
                        <p>Teachers must judge the presentations against the global impression
                            marking rubric using the level descriptors. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>These level descriptors are designed to be used as a whole, and
                                operate at a global level. </li>
                            <li>Different levels suggest typical performance, and there are always
                                exceptions requiring individual or case by case judgments. </li>
                            <li>The aim is to find the level descriptor that conveys most accurately
                                the level attained by the student, using a best-fit approach. A
                                best-fit approach in the case of global impression marking means
                                that the performance of students can be uneven across different
                                aspects of the assessment, but it is the overall impression that is
                                most important. </li>
                            <li>Within a level descriptor, teachers should award the upper mark if
                                the student’s work demonstrates the qualities described to a great
                                extent; the work may be close to achieving marks in the level above.
                                Teachers should award the lower marks if the student’s work
                                demonstrates the qualities described to a lesser extent; the work
                                may be close to achieving marks in the level below. </li>
                            <li>Only whole numbers should be recorded; partial marks, (fractions and
                                decimals) are not acceptable. </li>
                            <li>The highest descriptor levels do not imply faultless performance and
                                teachers should not hesitate to use the extremes if they are
                                appropriate descriptions of the work being assessed. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>How teachers and moderators will make a judgment about the level of
                            performance attained in a particular student response will vary. They
                            may make a decision in the course of watching a presentation and then
                            confirm this after the video ends, or they may register their
                            observations as they watch and give the mark in retrospect. In either
                            case, the described levels are to be seen as global and holistic rather
                            than a checklist of necessary characteristics. </p>
                        <p>It is recommended that the global impression marking rubric be made
                            available to students. </p>
                        <p>Moderators will check students’ coversheets carefully, although no marks
                            are awarded for these. </p>

                        teaching and learning can be found in this section of this subject guide,
                        and also under In practice. Additionally, a suite of materials on approaches
                        to teaching and learning in the Diploma Programme is available on the OCC.

                        <h3>Teaching based on inquiry</h3>
                        <p>The idea behind inquiry-based teaching in IB programmes is to develop
                            students’ natural curiosity together with the skills of self-management,
                            thinking, research and collaborative learning so that they can become
                            motivated and autonomous life-long learners. </p>
                        <p>The most significant aspect of inquiry-based teaching is that students
                            are actively engaged in their own learning, constructing their own
                            understandings of interesting issues and phenomena. In a classroom where
                            inquiry-based teaching is happening, there is much interaction between
                            students and between them and the teacher. The teacher’s primary role in
                            such a setting is to promote questions and to facilitate the learning
                            process. Students have a degree of freedom to make decisions about how
                            to proceed in their learning process, which most often progresses from
                            the concrete towards the abstract. Examples of forms of inquiry-based
                            teaching include structured inquiry, open inquiry, experiential
                            learning, problem-based learning and case-based learning. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, teachers have perhaps a greater
                            opportunity to make room for inquiry-based teaching than in many other
                            DP subjects, given that content is prescribed in a more open-ended
                            manner. This is not coincidental: global politics is intended as a
                            course where students are encouraged to examine significant issues of
                            our time and issues they personally care about in an in-depth and
                            meaningful way. Therefore, inquiry-based teaching suits global politics
                            particularly well. Through their inquiries, students can learn not only
                            about the factual aspects of political issues but delve into the
                            background, motivation, assumptions and implications of political
                            beliefs, reasoning and decisions. While doing so, they come to
                            appreciate that no one obvious right answer to their inquiry is likely
                            but that political issues are contentious, and different answers have
                            different strengths and weaknesses based on the perspectives and
                            approaches chosen. </p>
                        <p>Examples of inquiry-based teaching approaches and activities in global
                            politics include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>individual and group research tasks, case studies and presentations
                                based on students’ own questions and areas of interest </li>
                            <li>shorter inquiries stimulated by news and current events</li>
                            <li>games in which students pursue various strategies in order to make
                                progress with respect to a political issue but where the outcomes of
                                the game are dependent on other players’ moves </li>
                            <li>role plays in which students act as political decision-makers,
                                advisors or commentators, perhaps over a period of time, treating
                                different yet interdependent political issues </li>
                            <li>TOK-style thinking with students in order to develop their
                                collective curiosity</li>
                            <li>readings and videos that emphasize the contested nature of knowledge
                                and hence encourage questioning </li>
                            <li>engagement with political actors through guest speakers and
                                visits.</li>

                        <h3>Teaching focused on conceptual understanding</h3>
                        <p>An important motivation for conceptually focussed teaching in IB
                            programmes is to help students build the ability to engage with
                            significant ideas about human beings and the world. Equally valuably,
                            discussion of the “big ideas” behind a topic can help students get to
                            the heart of <strong>why</strong> they are learning what they are
                            learning. </p>
                        <p>To appreciate the role of concepts in building lasting and significant
                            understandings, it is helpful to think of concepts as the building
                            blocks of students’ cognitive frameworks. When they are learning at a
                            conceptual level, students are integrating new knowledge into their
                            existing understandings. They see how seemingly discrete topics are
                            connected and are ready to transfer their learning to new contexts. A
                            subject emerges for them in a holistic light. In a classroom where
                            conceptually-focused teaching is happening, there is continuous movement
                            between facts and what they mean, with students being used to ask why
                            the facts matter as a natural part of their learning process. </p>
                        <p>In global politics, concepts are the main organizing elements of the
                            course. Selected key concepts to which instruction regularly returns can
                            help students make sense of a rapidly changing, interconnected world.
                            When teachers approach the various political issues examined in the
                            course from the perspective of what they add to students’ understanding
                            of, say, power, equality, sustainability or peace, students’ learning
                            becomes more meaningful. The issues as such are of interest. However,
                            there is recognition that underlying a specific issue is some wider and
                            important phenomenon the issue says something about. With such an
                            aspiration, learning becomes connected, transferable and deeper. </p>
                        <p>Examples of conceptually focused teaching approaches and activities in
                            global politics include: </p>

                            <li>thematic, regional or case study-based pathways through the course,
                                integrating relevant key concepts at appropriate points </li>
                            <li>explicit discussion of different, conflicting and complementary

                        <p>As young individuals and as members of local and global communities,
                            students make sense of the world through their life experiences and the
                            world around them. IB programmes emphasize contextualized teaching
                            because the more students can relate to their learning, the more likely
                            they are to engage with it. Equally valuably, through enabling students
                            to see the applications of their learning, contextualized teaching, like
                            conceptually focused teaching, helps students to get to the heart of
                                <strong>why</strong> they are learning what they are learning. </p>
                        <p>In order to appreciate the role of contexts for relevant learning, it is
                            helpful to think of contexts as students’ frames of reference. When they
                            are learning in a contextualized way, students are grounding abstract
                            ideas and new information in familiar real-life situations. In a
                            classroom in which contextualized teaching is happening, concepts and
                            theories are related to accessible and meaningful examples,
                            illustrations and stories, which again inform further conceptual and
                            theoretical understandings. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, contemporary examples, case studies and
                            real-life engagement with political issues bring the course to life.
                            Students learn that political issues are dynamic, varied and present at
                            all levels of global social organization: global issues have local
                            ramifications and local issues are often a part of a wider phenomenon.
                            Which issues are relevant to study varies by when the course is taught,
                            and where and what the students’ particular interests are. Teachers’
                            free choice of examples in the core units and students’ free choice of
                            engagements in the engagement activity and case studies in the HL
                            extension make room for each global politics course and experience to be
                            different, reflecting the contextual nature of politics. </p>
                        <p>Examples of contextualized teaching approaches and activities in global
                            politics include:</p>

                        <h3>Teaching focused on effective teamwork and collaboration</h3>
                        <p>IB programmes acknowledge that learning is a social activity. Students
                            and teachers come together, each with unique life experiences, beliefs,
                            ideas, strengths and weaknesses. They then interact with the intention
                            of making progress with, ideally, shared objectives and do so within a
                            specific cultural context. Learning is the result of these complex
                            interactions. An important aspect of the learning process is regular
                            feedback from students to teachers on what they have and have not yet
                            understood. Concrete and constructive feedback from teachers to students
                            on performance is similarly crucial for learning. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, developing an awareness of multiple
                            perspectives is at the heart of the course. Though many perspectives on
                            political issues can be discovered from literature and explored through
                            individual thinking, an appreciation for the contextual and deeply held
                            nature of political beliefs and positions can perhaps be most
                            effectively developed through social learning. When students practice to
                            listen and respond to one another respectfully and critically, they not
                            only discover a variety of perspectives other than their own but may
                            also start developing a civic spirit, experiencing that dialogue and
                            negotiation <em>can</em> lead to reasonable compromises and shared
                            understandings. Teamwork and collaboration model how political issues
                            are ideally solved in the real world and teach students to draw on each
                            other’s strengths. Students can gradually learn to appreciate that
                            different perspectives and ways of being in the world do not necessarily
                            mean an inability to work together but are on the contrary critical for
                            progress. </p>
                        <p>Examples of teaching approaches and activities focussed on effective
                            teamwork and collaboration in global politics include: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>establishing clear expectations of mindful behaviour from the
                                start—and following up with consequences if these are not met </li>
                            <li>modelling listening and interaction skills</li>
                            <li>teamwork in mixed language and cultural groups, either in changing
                                or permanent teams</li>
                            <li>formalized peer support in team work and collective responsibility

                        <h3>Teaching differentiated to meet the needs of all learners</h3>
                        <p>IB programmes promote equal access to the curriculum for all learners.
                            Differentiation entails planning for student differences through the use
                            of a variety of teaching approaches, implementing a variety of learning
                            activities and making a variety of formats and modes of exploring
                            knowledge and understanding available to students. It also involves
                            identifying, with each student, the most effective strategies for them
                            to develop, pursue and achieve realistic and motivational learning
                            goals. In the context of an IB education, special consideration often
                            needs to be given to students’ language backgrounds and skills.
                            Affirming students’ identity and valuing their prior knowledge are
                            important aspects of treating students as unique individuals and helping
                            them develop holistically as young human beings. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, a multiplicity of perspectives can often
                            be found most naturally in the classroom. Different students are
                            interested in different political issues, their beliefs and positions on
                            the same political issue differ, and they are differently placed to help
                            their classmates understand a certain key concept, theory, idea or
                            example. Teachers should identify and draw on this richness in their
                            planning and teaching. The engagements in the engagement activity and
                            the case studies in the HL extension give room for differentiated
                            learning and more individualized guidance. A challenge of
                            differentiation may be how to best to help all students acquire a
                            conceptual understanding of global politics—arguably the most
                            challenging aspect of the course, especially for second-language
                            learners and concretely oriented learners. Here, a variety of ways of
                            approaching the key concepts throughout the course is likely to be most
                            helpful, in addition to being alert from the beginning on which students
                            are struggling with the conceptual layers and how they could be helped
                            on a more individual or small-group basis. </p>
                        <p>Examples of teaching approaches and activities differentiated to meet the
                            needs of all learners in global politics include: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>a variety of teaching approaches, learning activities and examples,

                        <h3>Teaching informed by assessment (formative and summative)</h3>
                        <p>Assessment plays a crucial role in IB programmes in supporting learning
                            and in measuring learning. Formal Diploma Programme assessments are
                            based on course aims and objectives and, therefore, effective teaching
                            to the course requirements also ensures effective teaching to the
                            summative assessment requirements. Formative assessments developed by
                            teachers are tools and processes to improve student learning. Here,
                            feedback is most effective as a two-way channel: students learn how they
                            are doing, and teachers learn what students understand, struggle with,
                            and find engaging—or not worthwhile. In addition to assessment tasks,
                            such feedback can be provided more informally, through for example
                            individual and group feedback sessions, surveys, polls or brief
                            reflections. </p>

                        <h3>Thinking skills</h3>
                        <p>IB programmes pride themselves on giving students opportunities to
                            develop their thinking skills and an awareness of themselves as thinkers
                            and learners. Being “thinkers” is one of the IB learner profile
                            attributes, and is defined in terms of exercising initiative in applying
                            thinking skills critically and creatively to recognise and approach
                            complex problems, and make reasoned, ethical decisions. </p>
                        <p>Thinking skills consist of a large number of related skills. In the
                            Diploma Programme, particular emphasis is placed on skills such as
                            metacognition, reflection, critical thinking, creative thinking, and
                            transfer. <em>Metacognition</em>, or control over one’s cognitive
                            processes of learning, can be thought of as a foundation for developing
                            other thinking skills. When practicing metacognition, students think
                            about the ways in which they process information, find patterns, build
                            conceptual understandings, and remember key facts and ideas. Once they
                            become aware that they are using a variety of techniques and strategies
                            to perform even the most basic learning tasks, students can be
                            encouraged to consider if there are more effective or efficient ways to
                            achieve the same learning, try out these new ways and evaluate them.
                            Similarly, reflection is a thinking skill that plays a critical role in
                            improving learning. When practicing reflection, students think about the
                            success, value or otherwise of their learning. The Diploma Programme
                            course aims, assessment objectives and assessment tasks place a premium
                            on higher order thinking skills, such as critical thinking, creative
                            thinking and transfer. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, the thinking skills described above are
                            practiced continuously; in fact, one way to view the subject is as a
                            space where students can learn to think about the world they inhabit in
                            richer and deeper ways. While metacognition and reflection are skills
                            that teachers need to consciously build into the learning routines of
                            the course, critical thinking, creative thinking and transfer are
                            emphasized in the set-up of the global politics curriculum and
                            assessment. Working with the global politics course on a conceptual
                            level and exploring political issues through a variety of perspectives
                            and approaches exposes students to many thoughts. Many thoughts require
                            sorting and evaluation and spark further new ideas. For example, while
                            working with the same key concept or political issue on a global,
                            national and community levels, students connect related ideas, recognize
                            that the “story” may look very different (depending upon which actors
                            are the focus) and develop an ethical response. While thinking through
                            such matters, they engage in critical thinking, creative thinking and
                            transfer of thoughts from one area of global politics to another. </p>

                            <li>starting learning sequences with activities that engage students’
                                minds, such as activating their pre-existing views on contentious
                                issues, visual thinking, thinking through analogies,
                                think-pair-share activities </li>
                            <li>closing learning sequences similarly, such as mapping learning to

                                essence of an idea, engaging in the routine “I used to think ... now
                                I think” </li>

                        <h3>Communication skills</h3>
                        <p>Communication skills are important in IB programmes for success in school
                            disciplines but are also an essential part of a wider positive dynamic
                            in the learning community: they help to form and maintain good
                            relationships between students, and between students and adults.
                            Furthermore, being able to communicate well contributes to the
                            development of students’ self-confidence and enhances their future
                            prospects, as communication skills are a critical ingredient of success
                            in working life. </p>
                        <p>Communication skills consist of a cluster of different skills and forms
                            of communication. The ability to listen and understand various spoken
                            messages, to read and understand diverse written texts and other forms
                            of media, and to respond clearly and convincingly in spoken, written and
                            digital form are all part of how students and human beings reach outside
                            of themselves. Some of these forms of communication are independent of
                            era and culture, but interacting in and with the digital space is a
                            significant part of communication and social interaction for most
                            students. Often collaborative in nature and with much creative
                            potential, online activities present exciting opportunities for
                            development of students’ communication skills through engagement with
                            new, previously inconceivable tasks. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, all of the above mentioned communication
                            skills are practiced. Examination of complex political issues invites
                            dialogue, discussion and debate, but also requires reflective engagement
                            with arguments and views expressed in academic literature, popular
                            opinion and news. When students write and present on political issues,
                            ideas and concepts, their own arguments and beliefs are clarified.
                            Essays, reports, shorter writing tasks and oral presentations are often
                            the assessable end outcome of a learning sequence, and make up students’
                            summative assessment in global politics. </p>
                        <p>Examples of approaches and activities that develop students’

                        <h3>Social skills</h3>
                        <p>Closely related to communication skills are social skills, whose
                            importance in IB programmes, perhaps even more than that of
                            communication skills, has to do with the development of the learner as a
                            whole and the value of a community for learning. A starting point for
                            developing students’ social skills is to acknowledge that people differ
                            greatly in terms of their degree of introversion or extroversion and
                            that these differences should be respected. Similarly, different
                            cultures have different expectations on appropriate behaviours in social
                            situations. To be able to understand the perspectives of others, to form
                            good relationships and to regulate one’s own emotions and behaviour are
                            at the heart of many of the IB learner profile attributes and the IB’s
                            aspiration to develop international-minded students. School, being such
                            a formative community in young people’s lives, can play a significant
                            part in the development of their social and emotional skills. Arguably,
                            helping students to appreciate their contributions to the “human
                            project” and connecting these with others’ contributions is the most
                            valuable life skill education can contribute towards. </p>
                        <p>From the perspective of learning, the ability to collaborate is a
                            particularly important social skill. The role of and potential for
                            collaboration in global politics is addressed in the sub-section
                            “Teaching focused on effective teamwork and collaboration”. </p>

                    <div class="section">
                        <h3>Self-management skills</h3>
                        <p>In addition to practicing life in relation to others, IB learners also
                            need to learn to persevere and be emotionally stable as individuals.
                            Often, of course, these two processes go hand in hand, as membership and
                            support of a community is critical for individual well-being. Learning
                            to manage themselves is important for students in a demanding
                            educational programme like the IB programmes, as well as a highly
                            helpful competency in their later, potentially quite fast-paced lives. </p>
                        <p>Self-management skills consist of organization skills, such as setting
                            goals and managing time and tasks effectively, and affective skills,
                            such as managing one’s state of mind, motivation and resilience. Like
                            other learning skills, self-management skills can be modelled and
                            practised. For DP students, time management is often a particularly
                            pertinent organization skill. Strategies for improving time management
                            include breaking down assignments into achievable steps and timelining
                            each step, planning revision and study plans for tests and examinations,
                            and building study timetables. An important aspect of such strategies is
                            not only what they factually do with students’ use of time but that they
                            give students a perception of greater control over their time. Affective
                            self-management skills, in turn, enable students to gain some control
                            over their mood, their motivation, and their ability to deal with
                            setbacks and difficulties. A school environment where students feel they
                            have a degree of autonomy and self-direction and where they do not need
                            to get things right the first time, setting of challenging but not too
                            difficult objectives, and even psychological techniques, such as
                            mindfulness training, can all support the development of students’
                            affective skills. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, students face a more open-ended course
                            than in many other DP subjects, and need to come to terms with this
                            open-endedness. On one hand, they have a wonderful opportunity to focus
                            on issues of particular interest to them, which can be highly
                            motivational. On the other hand, they must conduct their inquiries in
                            the context of the course framework, always returning to the key
                            concepts and remembering to move on so as to ensure coverage of all
                            course requirements. Teachers, of course, guide them in this process.
                            The subject matter of global politics can teach students much about
                            affective skills, as they study inspirational individuals at all levels
                            of global politics. </p>
                        <p>Examples of approaches and activities that develop students’

                        <h3>Research skills</h3>
                        <p>Research skills are a central element of the inquiry-based pedagogy of IB
                            programmes. While good research skills have always been at the heart of
                            academic endeavour, the availability of digital resources and the
                            explosion in the amount of information easily accessible to students
                            make the development of research skills a particularly pertinent part of
                            today’s education. Also, learning to work in an academically honest way
                            and respecting others’ intellectual contributions is an important aspect
                            of learning in all IB programmes. </p>
                        <p>Fundamental research skills include formulating focused and precise
                            research questions, appraising sources, recording, analysing, evaluating
                            and synthesizing information, and presenting and evaluating results.
                            These research skills are just as critical in the digital era as they
                            have always been. However, research today requires much more validating,
                            comparing and contrasting available information, and narrowing down the
                            volume of data into a manageable quantity and to what is relevant.
                            Though confident in browsing and communicating online, students often
                            lack the information literacy skills they need for the kind of effective
                            and self-directed research they are expected to do as part of their
                            inquiries. </p>
                        <p>In the global politics course, students have ample and excellent
                            opportunities to practice their research skills. A course in current
                            affairs where the key concepts, theories and ideas are grounded in local
                            and global examples, students need to engage in varied research,
                            depending on the type and geography of the political issue they examine
                            for any given task. They get exposed to various types of media and
                            encounter more and less reliable sources. The summative assessment tasks
                            of the course and the types of learning activities that lend themselves
                            well to learning about dynamic and continuously evolving political
                            issues require engagement with the world through research; there is no
                            stationary body of global politics knowledge that could be studied from
                            a textbook. The self-selected case studies of the HL extension are one
                            of the best opportunities in the Diploma Programme to do in-depth
                            research, as are, of course, extended essays in global politics. </p>

                        <p>The Diploma Programme global politics course, building on several
                            school-based syllabuses in the politics area and developed through a
                            3-year pilot involving 30 IB World Schools offering the Diploma
                            Programme around the world, draws on a variety of disciplines in the
                            social sciences and humanities. It offers students the opportunity to
                            explore fundamental political concepts such as power, equality,
                            sustainability and peace in a range of contexts. It allows students to
                            develop an understanding of the local, national, international and
                            global dimensions of political activity and processes, as well as to
                            explore political issues affecting their own lives. A central feature of
                            the course is that political concepts and issues are examined from
                            multiple perspectives. </p>
                        <p>Although the syllabus is explicitly concept-based, it helps students to
                            understand abstract political concepts by grounding them in real-world
                            examples and case studies. It also invites comparison between such
                            examples and case studies to ensure a wider and transnational
                            perspective. Throughout the global politics course, teachers have the
                            opportunity to choose relevant examples and case studies to ensure that
                            the course appropriately meets their students’ needs regardless of their
                            location. The examples listed in the <em>Global politics guide</em> are
                            suggestions only and may be substituted for others according to the
                            specific interests and needs of the teacher and students, provided that
                            the examples studied offer a variety of perspectives on the issues
                            examined. </p>
                        <p>The core units of the course offer students a broad introduction to the
                            key actors and interactions in contemporary global politics before
                            delving into the political aspects of human rights, development, and
                            peace and conflict. Together, the core units of the course make up the
                            central unifying theme of “people, power and politics”. The emphasis on
                            “people” reflects the fact that the course explores politics not only at
                            a state level but also explores the function and impact of non-state
                            actors, communities, groups and individuals. The concept of “power” is
                            emphasized as being particularly crucial to understanding the dynamics,
                            tensions and outcomes of global politics. Throughout the course, issues
                            such as conflict, migration or climate change are explored through an
                            explicitly political lens; “politics” provide a uniquely rich context in
                            which to explore the relationship between people and power. </p>
                        <p>The common internal assessment task at standard level (SL) and higher
                            level (HL) is an engagement activity. The emphasis of the task is on
                            encouraging students to personally engage with a political issue,
                            specifically with a local or otherwise personally significant
                            manifestation of one of the issues arising from their study of global
                            politics. The task involves both engagement as well as complementary
                            research; therefore, the engagement and the political issue embedded in
                            it should be carefully selected so that students can capture both the
                            experiential and analytical aspects of the task in their written
                            reports. </p>
                        <p>The HL extension, also internally assessed, is based on case studies,
                            allowing students to delve deeply into two global political challenges
                            that are of particular interest to them. Their analysis is informed by
                            what they are learning in the core units, with additional in-depth
                            research into the particular political issues they are examining. The
                            intention is that students, in their carefully prepared oral
                            presentations of the case studies, would be able to not only discuss the
                            factual aspects of the cases but place them into the wider context of
                            global politics. </p>

                                        orientation will hopefully continue into their adult lives
                                        and translate into principled action. </p>

                                    their classroom and their research will reveal further
                                    perspectives. Appreciation and exploration of multiple
                                    perspectives and approaches is at the heart of the global
                                    politics course and it is also intended that students need to be

                                    political beliefs may change over time. Evaluation of a range of
                                    points of view is a key skill developed in the course. </td>

                        <h2>Planning the course</h2>
                        <p>The Diploma Programme global politics course consists of four obligatory
                            core units: power, sovereignty and international relations; human
                            rights; development; and peace and conflict. All SL and HL students
                            study these four core units and complete an engagement activity; HL
                            students additionally do self-selected case studies on two global
                            political challenges from a choice of six (environment, poverty, health,
                            identity, borders and security). The HL extension is designed so that
                            its teaching aligns with the teaching of the core units under various
                            timetable arrangements for SL and HL students. </p>
                        <p>Given the dynamic, interconnected and complex nature of today’s world, no
                            two iterations of the global politics course are the same: different
                            political issues have relevance at different times and in different
                            places. While it sets out a clear framework and specifies the topics of
                            study, the global politics course is designed to give teachers and
                            students the flexibility to build up a learning journey that is
                            meaningful for their specific context. Such freedom implies, however,
                            that careful planning is required. Based on the global politics pilot
                            experiences, teachers of this course need plenty of time for planning
                            and reflecting on their work. </p>
                        <p>A necessary starting point for all teachers planning for the two-year
                            global politics course is to familiarize themselves with the elements of
                            the course. </p>

                        <p>More information on each of the course elements can be found in the
                            “Syllabus content” section of the <em>Global politics guide</em>. The
                            “External assessment” and “Internal assessment” sections of the guide
                            explain how the different elements feature in the various global
                            politics assessment tasks. </p>
                        <p>The global politics pilot experiences indicate that there are as many
                            ways of setting up the two-year sequence of global politics as there are
                            teachers. Many pilot teachers found themselves experimenting with
                            different planning anchors at different points of the course, and on
                            different iterations of teaching, depending on which topics and
                            political issues they were covering and what their students’ specific
                            needs were. A flexible and iterative approach to planning is necessary
                            for teachers of global politics. </p>

                            <h3>Planning for the core units</h3>
                            <p>Some examples of structuring learning in the core units, based on the
                                global politics pilot, include the following approaches. </p>
                            <ul>

                                    <strong>Linear, topic-based progression</strong>: Start with a
                                    comprehensive coverage of the foundational unit and then do the
                                    other three units, either in the order stated in the <em>Global
                                        politics guide</em> or in another order. Advantages of this
                                    approach are that students get a good overview of the central
                                    actors and interactions of global politics at the beginning of
                                    the course and may feel a sense of security about the syllabus
                                    “being covered” during the two-year course. Disadvantages of the
                                    linear approach include that learning may become a little
                                    mechanical, especially in the foundation unit where the scene is
                                    set. As there is a lot of terminology and more theoretical
                                    content, the coverage of which may become quite formulaic unless
                                    examples are used particularly effectively. Refer to a <a

                                    <strong>Non-linear, but still topic-based, progression</strong>:
                                    Start with an outline coverage of the learning outcomes of the
                                    foundational unit (power, sovereignty and international
                                    relations) but do not worry about covering all topics of the
                                    unit in detail, as these can be revisited when working with the
                                    other three units. For example, start with the learning outcome
                                    “nature of power”, an overview of the other key concepts of the
                                    unit, and an overview of the role of states, international
                                    organizations and non-state actors in global politics; but leave
                                    the details of the types of actors and interactions to be
                                    treated when discussing issues of human rights, development, and
                                    peace and conflict. Do not worry about strict unit-by-unit
                                    coverage later on in the course either, since many topics across
                                    units complement one another. For instance, many human rights
                                    and development issues can be investigated while examining
                                    conflicts in global politics. An advantage of this approach is
                                    that learning is anchored in real-world examples from the start
                                    of the course, so that students learn to appreciate the
                                    connections between the different units and topics. </li>

                                    <strong>Approaching global politics through large case
                                        studies</strong>: Select a few case studies of contemporary
                                    global politics. These are often rooted in some complex events
                                    and situations in a specific place and time and should be chosen
                                    for the richness of their connections to the Diploma Programme
                                    global politics syllabus. Examine these cases through a
                                    combination of well-structured inquiries and theoretical
                                    interludes. An ambition in the choice of cases and learning
                                    about them is for students to build up an understanding of, not
                                    only the particular cases but also what the cases reveal about
                                    the wider context of global politics. Advantages of this
                                    approach include its emphasis on the real world as the centre of
                                    the course as well as the possibility of using case studies that
                                    tie to the HL global political challenges. Refer to samples of

                                        political issues</strong>: Select a few large and pertinent
                                    political issues, themes or phenomena—such as migration, human
                                    trafficking, foreign aid and environmental catastrophes—and
                                    examine case studies and examples that fit under the umbrella of
                                    these issues. Integrate the teaching of the key concepts,
                                    learning outcomes and prescribed content of the core units
                                    within the study of the case studies and examples. An advantage
                                    of this approach is its in-depth engagement of students in
                                    significant real-world issues as well as the possibility of
                                    using the HL global political challenges as issues. Also,
                                    compared to the case study method students may potentially make
                                    the required theoretical and conceptual connections easier when
                                    the real-world case studies and examples they study are
                                    themselves thematically connected. A carefully guided path
                                    through their inquiries is still necessary. Refer to a <a

                                        perspectives</strong>: Select some perspectives on global
                                    politics, such as the perspectives of gender, ethnicity and
                                    religion as suggested in the <em>Global politics guide</em>.
                                    Examine case studies and examples that illustrate how political
                                    issues “look different” depending on the lens through which they
                                    are viewed. Integrate the teaching of the key concepts, learning
                                    outcomes and prescribed content of the core units within the
                                    study of the case studies and examples. An advantage of this
                                    approach is that it opens students’ eyes to the significance of
                                    perspective in global politics and to the fact that there rarely
                                    is one “right” answer to a situation, which in turn helps
                                    students to develop as critical thinkers. However, be wary of
                                    the selected perspectives becoming too influential in students’
                                    interpretation of political issues. Build a carefully guided
                                    path through students’ inquiries and ensure that the theoretical
                                    elements of the course get covered. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>While any of the latter three approaches may conceivably be used as a
                                principle of designing the entire core course and of covering all of
                                its key concepts, learning outcomes and prescribed content, pilot
                                experiences indicate that these approaches may lend themselves more
                                naturally to merely planning some learning sequences in the course.
                                Even then, when structuring learning around case studies and
                                examples, teachers need to plan carefully so that any examination of
                                how global politics unfolds in the real world supports the
                                development of students’ understanding of the key concepts, learning
                                outcomes and prescribed content of the Diploma Programme global
                                politics course. </p>
                            <p>All of the five planning approaches introduced and exemplified in

                                the extension is designed so that teaching can start right away and
                                run parallel to the teaching of the core units but it is also
                                possible to work with the HL extension in larger parts throughout
                                the course. The general nature of the guidance provided here about
                                planning for the HL extension is also influenced by the fact that
                                there is no additional prescribed content for the HL extension, and
                                it is ideally the students who drive the process and progress of
                                this part of the global politics course. For each of their two case
                                studies of global political challenges, students need to complete
                                research as well as preparation for their presentations, and the
                                majority of the 90 hours recommended for HL work should be devoted
                                to these tasks. To instill in students a sense of ownership of their
                                case studies, teachers should plan how the 90 hours are best spent
                                in close cooperation with their students. </p>
                            <p>In planning for the HL extension, it may be helpful to take a
                                starting point in the two sets of skills that the extension aims to
                                allow students to practise: research skills and presentation skills.
                                When planning the extension, teachers and students should ask
                                themselves what they can do to help build these skills. Detailed
                                guidance about the recommended <strong>individual</strong> research
                                and presentation preparation process culminating in the two recorded
                                oral presentations is given in the “Syllabus content” section of the
                                    <em>Global politics guide</em>. Approaches to structuring
                                learning in the HL extension for the <strong>whole group</strong>,
                                based on the global politics pilot, include the following examples. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The HL extension work could start with an overview of all the
                                    six global political challenges where students identify how the
                                    challenges tie into the key concepts of the course, or how and
                                    why the environment, poverty, health, identity, borders, and
                                    security present <strong>global </strong>and <strong>political
                                    </strong>challenges <em>.</em>
                                </li>
                                <li>The HL extension work could start with the whole group doing
                                    practice case studies within at least one of the six global
                                    political challenges, with activities such as collaborative
                                    research, peer feedback on plans and presentations, and practice
                                    for recording videos of presentations. Such activities could
                                    continue throughout the course; doing practice presentations is
                                    fully encouraged. </li>
                                <li>During the HL extension work, regular, whole-group activities
                                    could be built in that are specifically designed to strengthen
                                    students’ research and presentation skills and to support their
                                    individual work. For example, students could work together on a
                                    digital “best-practice research handbook for global politics”;
                                    or have a rotating responsibility for finding a “video of the
                                    week” showing an excellent presentation and/or presenter,
                                    justifying their choice and then viewing and discussing these
                                    videos in class. Naturally, teachers should design whole-group
                                    activities based on common development needs that are uncovered
                                    during the individual research and presentation preparation
                                    process, such as finding reliable sources, referencing,
                                    identifying a political issue in a case study, moving from facts
                                    to arguments or building an effective presentation storyline.

                        <h2>Planning units</h2>
                        <p>A unit is a sequence of learning that forms a logical whole and for which
                            it makes sense to design a more detailed plan. Many teachers find that a
                            natural length of a unit is about four to eight weeks of learning but
                            this varies based on how their course as a whole is designed. </p>
                        <p>The suite of Diploma Programme teaching and learning materials, available
                            on the OCC, includes example Diploma Programme unit planners. When doing
                            unit-level planning, Diploma Programme teachers are recommended to
                            consider the following types of questions. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Purpose of the unit</strong>: Which course aims and
                                assessment objectives will be addressed? What essential
                                understandings, inquiry questions or big ideas drive learning in the
                                unit? What potential connections are there to students’ study of
                                theory of knowledge (TOK) and their experiences in creativity,
                                activity, service (CAS)? </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Content and skills</strong>: What will the students learn?
                                In the context of global politics, which political issues will be
                                studied in the unit, at which levels of analysis, and from which
                                perspectives? Which key concepts, learning outcomes and prescribed
                                content will be covered? Which theoretical foundations will be
                                relevant? Which skills central to the course and its assessment will
                                the students practise? </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Overall plan of activities</strong>: How will the students
                                learn? In this unit, what are the appropriate emphases on the
                                various stages of the learning process: do we focus on affirming
                                students’ identity, strengthening and valuing their previous
                                understandings, supporting new learning or extending learning
                                through application and evaluation? Which approaches to teaching and
                                learning will be emphasized? Which overall learning strategies (such
                                as lectures, seminars, debates, group work, presentations or
                                simulations) will be used? What is the outline of the specific
                                learning activities? What resources are needed for learning? How
                                will learning be differentiated? </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Assessment</strong>: How will the students be assessed on
                                their learning? How will they themselves and the teacher know how
                                they are progressing during the unit? How is it appropriate to
                                assess students at the end of the unit? </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Reflection</strong>: What obstacles are expected? Once
                                learning has started, is expected progress being made–by individual
                                students and by the whole group? What can be improved for next time?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While the elements (understanding of “political issues”, the key
                            concepts, learning outcomes, prescribed content, and so on) of the
                            global politics course are central to the overall design of the course,
                            they are instrumental to the more detailed planning that takes place at
                            the level of units and activities. Based on the pilot experiences, some
                            guidance can be given with respect to unit and activity planning. </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Concepts are a recommended anchor for unit and activity planning
                                in global politics.</strong> The 16 key concepts of the Diploma
                            Programme global politics course weave a conceptual thread through the
                            great variety of political issues that are studied during the course.
                            The key concepts: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>connect the examples and case studies from different places and
                                levels of global politics</li>
                            <li>deepen students’ understanding of prescribed content</li>
                            <li>are open to alternative interpretations</li>
                            <li>encompass different values and recommend different practices when
                                approached from different theoretical, cultural and individual
                                perspectives. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Due to their value to understanding global politics, the key concepts are
                            heavily emphasized in the course aims and assessment objectives.
                            However, the complexity and all-pervasiveness of these concepts also
                            makes them challenging for students. By giving the key concepts a
                            central place in unit and activity planning, teachers help students to
                            avoid the pitfalls of showing either a simplistic, “definition-like”
                            take or an implicit, unclear interpretation of these concepts in their
                            final assessment. </p>
                        <p>Consequently, it is recommended that teachers start and finish their
                            planning with the question: “How will this unit or activity help
                            students to build a rich and balanced understanding of the key concepts,
                            and to communicate about global politics in conceptual terms?” </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>“A rich and balanced understanding of global politics” is a
                                recommended decision criterion for how many, and what kinds of,
                                examples are studied for each topic. </strong>Each of the topics of
                            the course could be subdivided into a great variety of sub-topics and
                            could be studied through a great number of examples, all of which would
                            be relevant to global politics. Additionally, events in the outside
                            world are an endless source of fascinating discussions. No matter how
                            relevant and engaging working with examples is, one of the roles of the
                            Diploma Programme global politics teacher is to recognize when learning
                            needs to stay on track and move on—at the very least, in order to ensure
                            that students are well-prepared for their final assessment tasks in the
                            subject. A helpful criterion for deciding which examples to study, and
                            how deep to delve into them, is to ask the following questions. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Given the weight of this topic in the overall global politics

                        <h2>Planning activities</h2>
                        <p>Planning activities—either for a single lesson or for a sequence of
                            lessons—tends to be the most familiar and often the most dynamic stage
                            of planning for teachers. As with <a
                                href="tsm.html?doc=d_3_gplts_gui_1505_1_e&amp;part=2&amp;chapter=3"
                                >unit planning</a>, similar questions about the purpose of the
                            activity, content, skills, sub-activities and assessment need to be
                            answered. </p>
                        <p>While the elements (understanding of “political issues”, the key
                            concepts, learning outcomes, prescribed content, and so on) of the
                            global politics course are central to the overall design of the course,
                            they are instrumental to the more detailed planning that takes place at
                            the level of units and activities. Based on the pilot experiences, some
                            guidance can be given with respect to unit and activity planning. </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Concepts are a recommended anchor for unit and activity planning
                                in global politics.</strong> The 16 key concepts of the Diploma
                            Programme global politics course weave a conceptual thread through the
                            great variety of political issues that are studied during the course.
                            The key concepts: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>connect the examples and case studies from different places and
                                levels of global politics</li>
                            <li>deepen students’ understanding of prescribed content</li>
                            <li>are open to alternative interpretations</li>
                            <li>encompass different values and recommend different practices when
                                approached from different theoretical, cultural and individual
                                perspectives. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Due to their value to understanding global politics, the key concepts are
                            heavily emphasized in the course aims and assessment objectives.
                            However, the complexity and all-pervasiveness of these concepts also
                            makes them challenging for students. By giving the key concepts a
                            central place in unit and activity planning, teachers help students to
                            avoid the pitfalls of showing either a simplistic, “definition-like”
                            take or an implicit, unclear interpretation of these concepts in their
                            final assessment. </p>
                        <p>Consequently, it is recommended that teachers start and finish their
                            planning with the question: “How will this unit or activity help
                            students to build a rich and balanced understanding of the key concepts,
                            and to communicate about global politics in conceptual terms?” </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>“A rich and balanced understanding of global politics” is a
                                recommended decision criterion for how many, and what kinds of,
                                examples are studied for each topic. </strong>Each of the topics of
                            the course could be subdivided into a great variety of sub-topics and
                            could be studied through a great number of examples, all of which would
                            be relevant to global politics. Additionally, events in the outside
                            world are an endless source of fascinating discussions. No matter how
                            relevant and engaging working with examples is, one of the roles of the
                            Diploma Programme global politics teacher is to recognize when learning
                            needs to stay on track and move on—at the very least, in order to ensure
                            that students are well-prepared for their final assessment tasks in the
                            subject. A helpful criterion for deciding which examples to study, and
                            how deep to delve into them, is to ask the following questions. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>“Given the weight of this topic in the overall global politics
                                course, are these examples appropriate for students to gain a rich
                                and balanced understanding of the <strong>prescribed
                                    content</strong>? </li>

                        <p>Most teachers have their own methods and their own templates for planning

                                            can prove problematic. From the source: states often
                                            prioritize their national interests over international
                                            concerns. From own knowledge: the example of how states’
                                            motivation to develop economically can delay the
                                            implementation of environmental changes. </p>

                                            including: the extent to which cooperation and
                                            compromise are taking place; whether progress on
                                            international concerns are any easier today than in the
                                            past; whether states have the will to cooperate on

                                            source mentions an example while another does not. One
                                            mark is awarded for the basic level of contrast shown in

                                        <p>There are errors in terminology at the start of this
                                            paper—between questioning the legitimacy of a leader and
                                            the legitimacy of a state—that are never reconciled
                                            through the response. This is unfortunate as the
                                            candidate displayed a sound knowledge of the key concept
                                            of legitimacy, particularly in the references to
                                            specific thinkers. Unfortunately, though, this confusion
                                            renders much of the example (Trump and the USA)
                                            unsuitable for the purposes of answering the question at
                                            hand. The candidate provides a more solid response when
                                            considering other real-world examples, for example,
                                            where the legitimacy of a state or government has been
                                            subject to questioning. Here too, though, there is too
                                            much description and not enough actual analysis of how,
                                            why, and by whom state legitimacy might be questioned. A
                                            major oversight of this response is the lack of a clear
                                            counterclaim although some benefit of the doubt has been
                                            given in this respect. Overall, just enough to warrant a
                                            mark in the lower end of the 11–15 markband. </p>

                                            with a clearer exposition of the concept in the context
                                            of some contemporary real-world examples. In particular
                                            there was sophistication in the recognition that the

                                            clean environment and humanitarian labour standards but,
                                            importantly, what reasons such states might offer in
                                            their defence for doing so. The counterclaim was strong
                                            (especially as this is a challenging question) and,
                                            furthermore, it is evaluated. This is what propels an
                                            otherwise very solid paper into the top markband as it
                                            displays clear evidence of higher order thinking,
                                            although the inconsistencies and somewhat forced
                                            theoretical references restrict this to the lower end of
                                            the 21–25 markband. </p>

                                        <p class="Display">[Unit of study: Development] </p>
                                        <p>This is a rather uneven response, possibly because the
                                            candidate was determined to use the different models of
                                            development covered in their coursework. While this did
                                            work to a degree, tying each of these to the concept of
                                            inequality proved to be a little awkward. Certainly,
                                            modernization theory, dependency theory, and neo-liberal
                                            economic policies recognize that a degree of inequality
                                            may promote or, at least, co-exist with development for
                                            a range of reasons, as the candidate recognizes. The
                                            mention of dependency theory also showed merit as
                                            developing states must remain in the periphery if
                                            developed states are to maintain their pre-eminent
                                            position. However, the paucity of developed real-world
                                            examples—as well as a strange emphasis on developed
                                            states as supporting case studies—meant that this is not
                                            as effective a response as it could have been. Different
                                            views on the question are considered if we allow that
                                            the references to different development models fulfill
                                            this requirement, but a clearer counterclaim would have
                                            been preferred. Regardless, these different perspectives
                                            are not explored or evaluated. With all of this
                                            considered, a mark in the lower range of the 11–15

                                        <p class="Display">[Unit of study: Human rights] </p>
                                        <p>A rather good response to the question but one that does
                                            not fulfill its initial promise. The candidate commences
                                            strongly by noting that most, if not all, of the current
                                            industrialized states violated environmental and/or
                                            labour standards to reach their industrialized state.
                                            The implication here is that there is a certain degree
                                            of hypocrisy involved in developed states now attempting
                                            to deny (or at the very least, to criticize) developing
                                            states the same experience/trajectory. This was a rather
                                            nuanced start to the paper. However, the candidate then
                                            suddenly shifts focus to a discussion of some of the
                                            ways industrializing states have historically violated,
                                            and continue to violate, such rights in an effort to
                                            encourage economic growth/industrialization. While the
                                            analysis that ensues is good (in some respects more than
                                            others), one feels that an opportunity was missed here
                                            to engage in some sophisticated analysis and evaluation.
                                            There is a strange and descriptive mention of how the
                                            presence of inequality in all countries guarantees that
                                            rights are being violated, but there are no real-world
                                            examples in support of this assertion. A counterclaim is
                                            offered, but the argument that labour rights are not
                                            being violated in ASEAN states was extremely weak for a
                                            host of reasons, not least of which is that ASEAN’s own
                                            human rights declaration directly affirms all of the
                                            civil, economic, social, cultural and political rights
                                            in the UDHR. Despite this criticism, this remains a
                                            strong response and there was certainly enough to
                                            warrant a mark in the lower range of the 16–20 markband.

                                        <p>A solid, if uneven, response to the question. The
                                            candidate starts off strongly with a clear understanding
                                            of development and (in)equality as concepts. The
                                            references to the MDGs and SDGs were good, but much more
                                            could have been done here to highlight the stress both
                                            place on inequality as a hindrance to development
                                            efforts. Both the example of Brazil (income inequality
                                            and underdevelopment) and, especially, that of Nigeria
                                            (gender inequality and underdevelopment) were good, and
                                            highly relevant to the discussion at hand. The paper
                                            somewhat loses its way at this point as the candidate
                                            attempts to posit his or her counterclaim. The example
                                            of China was a little confused, in that it is never
                                            clear from the discussion what role inequality actually
                                            played in encouraging economic growth (and thus
                                            development) there. The conclusion is also a little
                                            abrupt with its quick, descriptive mention of how
                                            inequality may give rise to social unrest (that may then
                                            be violently quashed by the state). Still, for the most
                                            part, this was a strong enough response to justify a
                                            mark in the higher end of the 11–15 markband. </p>

                                            simply the absence of war.</h4>

                                        <p>The overall point being made in this response is good,
                                            but the execution is a little too repetitious and
                                            descriptive. The candidate does neatly recognize that a
                                            negative peace (in the sense of an absence of direct
                                            conflict) is necessary before other forms of peace can
                                            be realized, but that this is not enough in and of
                                            itself to qualify as “peace”. The main concern with this
                                            response is twofold. In the first instance, a clearer
                                            and more explicit conceptualization of positive peace
                                            needed to be made visible. Secondly, the real-world
                                            examples provided were either underdeveloped (Egypt),
                                            outdated (First World War and Second World War) or
                                            somewhat contradictory (while it is safe to assume that
                                            the Shias and other ethno-religious groups under
                                            Saddam’s regime were subject to structural violence in
                                            Iraq, it is certain that they suffered the effects of
                                            direct violence also). A counterclaim is included but it
                                            does not work well enough to attract a higher mark. All
                                            of this means that the candidate has done enough to
                                            warrant a mark in the 11–15 markband, but no higher.

                                        <p>Something of a mixed response. In places, the candidate
                                            has done a good job of outlining how economically
                                            powerful states can, in fact, manipulate institutions of
                                            global governance, such as the UN. In addition, he or
                                            she neatly recognizes how such power may also be
                                            constrained by the issue at hand. With this in mind, it
                                            is fair to say that the candidate has understood the
                                            demands of the question, and has displayed a more than
                                            satisfactory grasp of some key concepts of the global
                                            politics course. However, there are also numerous
                                            instances where the candidate becomes confused and the
                                            discussion descends into description, with some
                                            irrelevant and even flawed facts advanced. A
                                            counterclaim is attempted but is rather disingenuous in
                                            its approach. With all of this considered, a mark in the
                                            upper range of the 11–15 markband is appropriate. </p>

                                            and are therefore of little use to vulnerable

                                        <p class="Display">[Unit of study: Human rights] </p>
                                        <p>A relatively strong, if slightly disjointed, response to
                                            the question. The candidate does an admirable job of a
                                            decent, if somewhat unevenly structured, response to the
                                            question. The candidate ably outlines different reasons
                                            why human rights might be unenforceable with reference
                                            to a suitable range of valid, contemporary real-world
                                            examples. Generally this is done well, although some of
                                            the examples could have easily been developed further.
                                            The candidate then presents at least one compelling
                                            reason as to why human rights might still be of use to
                                            vulnerable populations even if it is the case that such
                                            rights are generally unenforced/unenforceable. While a
                                            straightforward counterclaim is not necessarily present
                                            the candidate has certainly done enough to explore
                                            alternative views on the question to fulfill this
                                            requirement. As such, the 16–20 markband is clearly
                                            warranted, but there is not enough evaluation or
                                            critical analysis to push this paper into the top
                                            markband. As noted above, the structure of the essay is
                                            quite problematic and this limited the upper range of
                                            the overall mark. Still, this remains a more than
                                            capable essay. </p>

                                        <p>Overall, an excellent response to the question at hand,
                                            although the candidate did seem to lose his or her way
                                            towards the end of the paper (perhaps striving to do too
                                            much as time was running out?). The conceptualization of
                                            the key ideas (positive and negative peace) and the
                                            different views surrounding each was adept, and
                                            real-world examples were generally used to good effect
                                            also. The counterclaims offered were excellent and it is
                                            clear that the candidate not only explored but also
                                            sought to evaluate these. Certainly, some of the
                                            examples needed to be developed a little further and
                                            there was one line of argument (the case of the EU
                                            towards the end of the piece) that seemed strangely out
                                            of place. In addition, the paper was a little disjointed
                                            in terms of its flow and the implication of the question
                                            could have been explored in a little more depth/detail.
                                            Regardless, this was a very fine essay. </p>

                                        <p>An interesting case as the candidate built pace and depth
                                            throughout the exam (it is more common to see a drop in
                                            these elements with the final essay). This is also a
                                            good example of a series of responses in which the
                                            candidate does not employ a “traditional” counterclaim

                                        <p>A very good response. The candidate has adequately
                                            demonstrated some of the expected bases for why or when
                                            a state’s legitimacy might be questioned, although it is
                                            true that much of the focus here is on the external and
                                            there is little mention of the domestic bases for such
                                            questioning (this alone restricts the upper limit of
                                            possible marks). In addition, while the real-world
                                            examples offered in support are relevant and
                                            contemporary, each needed to be explored in greater
                                            depth to award the top markband. A counterclaim is
                                            considered but it is neither explored nor evaluated.
                                            With all of this considered, a mark at the lower end of
                                            the 16–20 markband is warranted. </p>

                                            and are therefore of little use to vulnerable

                                        <p>A very strong response to the question at hand although
                                            one that, ultimately, falls just short of achieving the
                                            highest marks. The candidate has neatly scrutinized some
                                            of the reasons why human rights might be unenforceable.
                                            He or she then followed this up with a relatively
                                            nuanced, if underdeveloped, argument that human rights
                                            treaties and covenants might still be of some value and
                                            use to vulnerable populations (for example, in a
                                            normative sense at least, or as a reference point for
                                            such populations in any effort to draw attention to
                                            human rights violations). Again, the real-world examples
                                            provided as support are good and well explored. However,
                                            the response as a whole lacks the critical thinking and
                                            reflection required to achieve the top markband.
                                            Nevertheless, a very good essay. </p>

                                        <p>A very good response to the question. The candidate
                                            clearly distinguishes between the positive and negative
                                            dimensions of peace and ably supports this distinction
                                            with the inclusion of relevant real-world examples.
                                            However, while much was made of situations in which a
                                            negative peace was clearly not peace, per se, the
                                            candidate did not provide the same degree of analysis
                                            (or attention) to some of the processes required for a
                                            positive peace to prevail. Counterclaims were considered
                                            but were not really explored (or evaluated) in enough
                                            detail. Still, there was clearly enough here to warrant
                                            a mark in the mid-range of the 16–20 markband. </p>

                                            distinction needed to be explicitly stated and analysed.
                                            The failure to do so means that in several places the
                                            discussion does not actually address the demands of the
                                            question. Interestingly, the candidate recognized the
                                            existence of multiple bases for the legitimation of a
                                            state (charisma, history, religion, and economic
                                            performance). Unfortunately, however, the conclusions
                                            drawn did not always logically follow the discussion
                                            that preceded them. Generally, too much was asserted
                                            rather than actually established. Finally, a clear
                                            counterclaim could not be discerned. With all of this
                                            considered, a mark in the the mid-range of the 11–15
                                            markband was warranted. </p>

                                        <p>A very solid response to the question. The candidate has
                                            clearly acknowledged many of the issues surrounding the
                                            (un)enforceability of human rights, although there could
                                            have been a more explicit account of the role of the
                                            nation state in this regard. Also, more could have been
                                            made of the anarchical nature of international
                                            relations, and how the lack of a world government
                                            (and/or institutions of global enforcement) means that
                                            the enforcement of human rights is left to individual
                                            states (or, possibly, coalitions of states), who are
                                            often the primary violators of such rights. The same is
                                            true for the counterclaim, which is rather
                                            underdeveloped and needed to be explored in greater
                                            detail and/or depth to achieve a higher markband (for
                                            example, the normative reference point offered by
                                            treaties such as the UDHR, and the moral suasion of NGOs
                                            and IGOs, can be brought to bear on states so that they
                                            feel compelled to enforce human rights). It was good to
                                            see the candidate consider some of the implications of
                                            the difficulties associated with the (un)enforceability
                                            of human rights. With all of this considered, a mark in

                                        <p>An excellent and rather lucid response to the question.
                                            The candidate has neatly recognized the nuances involved
                                            in this question. In particular, the candidate has
                                            presented a compelling case that the complexity of
                                            attaining a lasting, positive peace requires an
                                            inherently contextual approach. Key concepts are
                                            succinctly defined and then explored and, most
                                            impressively, evaluated through the lens of various
                                            salient and contemporary real-world examples. In
                                            addition, different views on the question and central
                                            issue are explored and similarly evaluated. The paper is
                                            fluent in terms of its structure and was a joy to read;
                                            a top mark is warranted here. </p>

                                        <p>A more typical exam in that the candidate starts strongly
                                            and then fades a little (please note that in the
                                            original script the questions were answered in reverse
                                            numerical order). It is likely that the difference
                                            between the second and third answers are attributed to
                                            the conceptual slippage the candidate experiences in the
                                            second essay, otherwise I am confident that he or she
                                            could have scored more highly here. This serves as an
                                            apt example of the importance for teachers to remind
                                            their students to read (and understand) what a question
                                            demands of them. </p>

                                            of the question. Key points are well supported by
                                            contemporary real-world examples, but these do not
                                            contain the degree of detail required for the top
                                            markband to be achieved. In addition, some of the
                                            material included is irrelevant and/or has not been

                                            fully enough to warrant a higher mark. This is a clear
                                            example of a paper in the upper range of the 16–20

                                        <p>While there is some initial conceptual slippage between
                                            democracy and political stability, the candidate shows
                                            an admirable understanding of the central concepts
                                            contained within this question. In particular, there is
                                            a nuanced distinction between the two forms of stability
                                            and a neat transition from a discussion of one to the
                                            next in the context of development. Generally, this is
                                            quite a sophisticated treatment of the question, despite
                                            some occasional lack of depth when it comes to
                                            real-world examples. The counterclaim is also quite
                                            compelling, though it could have benefitted from a more

                                            simply the absence of war.</h4>

                                        <p>A very solid response to the question, one that displays
                                            a firm grasp of the key global politics concepts.
                                            However, there is something of a disconnect between some
                                            terms and examples and the question (and/or main points)
                                            being advanced—likely due to this being the final essay
                                            and the candidate having insufficient time remaining.
                                            All the main requirements of a response are included,
                                            but the lack of fluency in terms of connecting all the
                                            disparate parts together (along with some terminological
                                            gaps) means that this answer as a whole cannot score in

                                            (interviewing a government minister and some other

                                            components to allow for detailed analysis and
                                            exploration. Also, the comparison is well thought
                                            through, but rather ambitious for a 2,000-word report.
                                            Course content could have been explored in a more
                                            detailed fashion, with reference to sources. </p>

                                            prevent synthesis, but in the second half of the
                                            analysis both are effectively integrated, combining
                                            thoughtful reflections on the engagement with relevant
                                            academic literature. Exploration of different
                                            perspectives from the government to opposition parties
                                            to local NGOs and international actors. </p>

                                        <p>The report identifies a specific, detailed political
                                            issue and the engagement (and reflections) are

                                            by turning the holistic criteria into separate sections
                                            (introduction, explanation of engagement, and analysis),
                                            though it turns out the analysis provides plenty of
                                            effective synthesis between engagement and additional

                                        <p>The presentation, health care in Australia, begins with
                                            an overview of 250 years of Australian history and some
                                            social and economic indicators relating to contemporary
                                            Australia. Using the population graphs takes time,
                                            though there is a limited degree of analysis relative to
                                            the case study. His example of patient treatment is
                                            interesting but doesn't really develop the political
                                            aspects of the case study and, once again, takes time.
                                            There is no evident attempt to use global politics
                                            concepts to understand this case study. This is an
                                            example of the student treating the case study in
                                            isolation. The presentation runs well over the 10
                                            minutes allocated; the examiner would not be obliged to

                                        <p>The second presentation on UKIP and identity includes an
                                            overview of the case study: the economy/social
                                            conditions of the location (Clacton, United Kingdom).
                                            There is a useful description of the political life in
                                            Clacton and the UK but very limited discussion of global
                                            politics concepts or theories other than realism, which
                                            itself is not used effectively. The use of in/out group
                                            analysis with regard to identity does better. Nice
                                            analysis of UKIP language, which does take the
                                            presentation out of level 2. In summary, while focused
                                            and structured there is limited application of concepts
                                            and theories to a case study that is treated in
                                            isolation. </p>

                                        <p>The presentation is structured in a very clear way, but
                                            it feels like the student is ticking boxes—he describes
                                            the case study, introduces some concepts, then theories
                                            and then levels of analysis. One could even say there is
                                            a ”tendency to be more descriptive than evaluative”
                                            which would be level 3. The student describes the case
                                            study from an historical/chronological perspective.
                                            Sovereignty and identity are introduced a quarter of the
                                            way through, but neither is developed despite asking
                                            some interesting questions of those ideas.
                                            Liberalism/Realism/Marxism are introduced which shows
                                            some knowledge, but there is limited application of
                                            these theoretical perspectives. </p>

                                        <p>The second presentation, on the peace deal in Colombia,
                                            provides a detailed explanation of the case study but
                                            with only an occasional reference to a global politics
                                            concept. The student then introduces some concepts: sovereignty,
                                            hard power, legitimacy. There is evidence of knowledge
                                            of these concepts but they are not used as tools to
                                            explain or explore the case study. He then returns to
                                            his narrative. Justice is introduced as a concept but
                                            dealt with in a rhetorical way (We can ask that ...?).
                                            This style does not lead to any depth in the application
                                            of the concept. The theoretical approaches—realism,
                                            liberalism, critical approaches, Marxism—are used in a
                                            very schematic way and barely warrant a sentence each.
                                            The levels of analysis are presented similarly. There is
                                            little attempt to “integrate” the case study with the
                                            concepts and theories. The presentation runs well over

                                        <p>The focus from the beginning is on the description of the
                                            case study. The definitions are limited in their
                                            usefulness. The chronological description of the case
                                            study shows the candidate has a satisfactory/very good
                                            knowledge of the topic. Galtung is referred to but not
                                            developed to any degree. There is an acknowledgement of
                                            differing perspectives in the extended discussion of the
                                            peace deal. In summary, the presentation shows good
                                            knowledge and understanding and there is an analysis of
                                            the case study using some of the global politics
                                            concepts and theories visited in the course, but there
                                            is no development or exploration of the concepts
                                            themselves. </p>

                                        <p>The student spends a good deal of the presentation
                                            describing the case study. It enables her to show a good
                                            understanding of the topic and to allude to politically
                                            relevant points. Some acknowledgement of differing
                                            perspectives in discussing the various stakeholders is
                                            present. Galtung is used quite effectively to explain
                                            some aspects of the case study, but there is no
                                            evaluation of Galtung. In summary, this student shows a
                                            good understanding of the topic under discussion. She
                                            applies some theoretical analysis, making a connection
                                            rather than exploring fully the theories and concepts
                                            used. </p>

                                                  <strong>Identity</strong> and ”cultural Marxism”
                                                introduces the theoretic framework in an effective
                                                way. There is an Interesting distinction between
                                                moral and political issues. The student also uses
                                                realist conflict theory as a counter-argument.
                                                However, the theories are described rather than
                                                explored, while some of the political analysis of US
                                                politics lacks depth. A good comparison with the UK
                                                is made, which broadens the analysis. The conclusion
                                                shows his desire to prove rather than explore. This
                                                suggests an argumentative approach (”I believe”)
                                                rather than a balanced exploration of global
                                                politics theories and concepts. The difference
                                                between a level 5 and a level 4 in this instance
                                                stems from an uneven application and evaluation of
                                                connections to the wider context of global politics
                                                and a consistent exploration of different

                                            intervention in Mali, with a focus on a concept
                                            (national interest) that she hopes to explore. She uses
                                            concepts (liberalism) as a means to explain political
                                            actions. The student consistently explains and evaluates
                                            the case study using global politics terminology—the
                                            exploration of human rights is a good example of this.
                                            The case study is clearly dealt with using differing
                                            perspectives, theoretical and political. On the whole

                                            and concepts” and is thus a level 5. </p>

                                            political/cultural context, and conceptual discussion
                                            does not take place until approximately a quarter of the
                                            way through the presentation. The section on rhetorical
                                            analysis is interesting and might count as ”a high level
                                            of proficiency” in using the material. She is also
                                            engaging with the conceptual aspects of human rights.
                                            Concepts and theories are used to understand the case
                                            study rather than the case study being used to explore
                                            or understand a concept or theory. There is a nice
                                            development of justice with an acknowledgement of
                                            different perspectives. Her attempt to generalize about
                                            South-East Asia is less convincing, but on the whole
                                            there is a good description of the case study and some
                                            discussion of differing perspectives. </p>

                                        <p>The student demonstrates excellent understanding and
                                            clear analysis of multiple perspectivesand makes
                                            consistent links that place the case study within the
                                            global political context. From the beginning, she shows
                                            the global nature of the topic. Indeed the case study is
                                            an opening to an exploration of global politics
                                            concepts. All the concepts and ideas, terrorism, hard
                                            power, realism/liberalism, are defined within the
                                            context of the presentation. It is fair to say that the
                                            case study is used to explore these concepts and
                                            theories. There is specific reference to/use of a named
                                            theorist. The presentation is clearly structured and
                                            well-focused. She considers some counter-arguments with
                                            regards to “isolation”. There is clear evidence of
                                            research. There is reference to theoretical structure in
                                            the conclusion. </p>

                                        <p>This is an excellent case study that demonstrates
                                            thorough analysis and explores multiple perspectives
                                            with consistent links to theory. There is focus on
                                            far-right groups (populism) in anglophone countries. The
                                            student presents a thesis and how the concepts would be
                                            used within the context of the presentation. She draws
                                            conclusions from the evidence presented. The
                                            presentation is an exploration of concepts,
                                            globalisation and identity, and uses the examples as
                                            supportive illustrations of the concepts. There are
                                            claims and counter-claims. She uses a named theorist,
                                            Edward Saïd, to explore the lived political experience.
                                            The conclusion reiterates the thesis. Once again, the
                                            student moves beyond the case study to an exploration of
                                            perspectives. The case study is placed within the
                                            context of global politics throughout. </p>
